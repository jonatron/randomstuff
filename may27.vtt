WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Okay, I'm gonna punch it

00:04.240 --> 00:07.400
You wanted a pre-show you technically got one, okay?

00:08.560 --> 00:13.160
That's it. That's all you get nice shirt. Yeah, you need a nice shirt, bro. Okay. Here we go

00:15.520 --> 00:18.320
Are you gonna just like hang or oh

00:20.040 --> 00:25.220
Oh, I see okay, I mean you're more of the welcome it just will take a while

00:25.220 --> 00:31.300
Okay, okay, okay, everyone stand by

00:39.860 --> 00:44.940
Welcome to the WAN show everyone the truth is I screwed up this week. Yeah

00:45.460 --> 00:50.140
It's very obvious that I mean I just I couldn't conceal it anymore

00:50.460 --> 00:54.820
We were paid by NVIDIA for our RTX 4060 Ti review

00:55.460 --> 01:03.780
And the scariest part of what I just said is that a not insignificant number of people are gonna take that at face value

01:04.260 --> 01:06.260
Not watch any more of the video

01:06.820 --> 01:14.260
And believe it for the rest of their days. Let's talk about how confusing people found our review of the 4060 Ti

01:14.580 --> 01:20.820
We're also going to be talking to you guys about how confusing I'm finding Sony's new handheld accessory

01:21.380 --> 01:28.820
It's a Wi-Fi based PlayStation 5 streaming thing. Did they learn nothing from the Nintendo Wii U?

01:28.980 --> 01:35.140
What else we got going on this week? It does it does seem like the Wii U was just like actually too early at this point

01:35.140 --> 01:39.060
It's starting to feel that way really really feels like it. Uh, wow

01:50.820 --> 01:58.180
The show is brought to you today by Vessie signal wire and Corsair

01:59.060 --> 02:04.660
All right, we're gonna jump right over to my laptop here and this is one of those things where?

02:05.540 --> 02:09.620
Luke I feel like we need to open the conversation back up

02:10.740 --> 02:14.740
Open it back up about shadow banning come on shadow banning people do that

02:14.740 --> 02:21.620
Because just do it. I actually found the comment section of this video extremely difficult to handle

02:24.180 --> 02:30.420
Let's see you see some people get it. Please keep calling out this nonsense. This was an extremely

02:31.060 --> 02:34.180
Negative review it started with oh

02:34.660 --> 02:38.180
Thank you Nvidia at least you didn't doubt it

02:38.340 --> 02:46.340
Negative review it started with oh, thank you Nvidia at least you didn't downgrade this graphics card

02:47.060 --> 02:49.060
I literally

02:49.460 --> 02:58.420
Literally said something actually positive after some negative things and then I said, okay that last one wasn't sarcastic

02:59.380 --> 03:07.780
Because I am aware that a not insignificant portion of our audience does have a little bit of trouble picking up on sarcasm

03:08.180 --> 03:13.140
Whether it's uh like a social cue challenge thing or whether it's the fact that english isn't their second language

03:13.220 --> 03:18.020
English is a really weird language rather is their second language. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so I I made it

03:18.980 --> 03:20.980
actually explicit

03:21.620 --> 03:25.540
And the number of comments that are just

03:27.700 --> 03:32.420
Let me let me see if I can let me see if I can let me see if I can find this um

03:32.660 --> 03:34.660
Oh

03:35.300 --> 03:40.660
Man, this is see this is frustrating because you need them. They're not there. Yeah, the second one. I need it. Yeah

03:41.060 --> 03:45.700
It's it's not there. That's just that's just how like presenting things on stage or on camera

03:45.700 --> 03:50.100
It's just how it's just how it works. Okay. Where's my phone because I sent you one on discord. That was just

03:50.660 --> 03:55.700
Absolutely mind-blowing the point is not to call it any specific user. Don't go looking for this

03:55.940 --> 04:00.500
But I've got a couple comments in a row here like why can't you just say it's a bad deal?

04:00.980 --> 04:04.420
You're not crapping on nvidia. It makes it look like you're caping for nvidia

04:04.740 --> 04:06.980
Not saying you are but that's what it looks like

04:07.460 --> 04:13.460
This review also feels short and unrigorous. This is a rare thumbs down for me. We had

04:14.900 --> 04:20.500
Probably more game benchmarking. Yeah, then just then we've ever had before

04:21.380 --> 04:27.060
Extremely rigorous. The whole thing is automated now. All of our testing. This is something to note

04:27.540 --> 04:34.580
All of our testing was fresh on the latest drivers for every one of those cards. That is extremely unusual

04:34.660 --> 04:40.820
But it's also extremely important. I mean you can include numbers from three months ago or six months ago

04:41.060 --> 04:46.020
But as we've seen especially with intel ark and especially when amd launches anything

04:46.500 --> 04:49.060
within a span of two three six months

04:50.100 --> 04:52.740
You might as well just you might as well just say

04:53.460 --> 04:56.580
I hate amd and don't feel like showing them in a fair light

04:56.820 --> 05:00.260
You might as well just say that because if you're not including fresh numbers

05:01.220 --> 05:07.380
That's not valid. It's it's just actually useless. You might as well just kind of go. You might as well approximate

05:08.100 --> 05:12.340
Well, I didn't have the x t so I I don't know it has 10 percent more

05:12.740 --> 05:18.820
C us so I bumped the clock speed 10 percent. This is an approximation and you know what it would probably be reasonably close

05:19.460 --> 05:25.140
But it's disingenuous to label the chart, you know, 6700 x t or whatever it is

05:25.780 --> 05:27.300
This this next one

05:27.300 --> 05:29.300
Uh, thank you

05:29.460 --> 05:36.340
I've I haven't been watching ltt and now I remember why the only reason I clicked was I was hoping the title was sarcasm

05:36.580 --> 05:40.740
But weird how he kept looking for positive things to say when the card is straight up garbage

05:41.220 --> 05:48.020
Trying to stay in nvidia's good books. I haven't been in nvidia's good books years for like a couple years now

05:49.780 --> 05:53.540
That's that's not how this works. That's not how any of this works

05:53.940 --> 05:54.820
Um

05:54.820 --> 06:01.940
The reason that we're looking for positive things to say is because our reviews are designed to be everything you need

06:01.940 --> 06:06.020
To know about the card and the price the price is fluid

06:06.660 --> 06:12.420
Right, so if you come back to this video in a couple years and you want to know what features does it have

06:13.140 --> 06:15.540
How does it compare to the cards that are?

06:16.100 --> 06:23.300
You know similar around it and honestly one of the things the labs did a great job of this time was including older cards

06:23.940 --> 06:27.940
The number of positive comments we got from people saying wow

06:28.580 --> 06:32.980
Thank you so much for putting a couple of older cards on the graph for a change

06:33.380 --> 06:39.300
Now I have some idea how this compares when I'm you know looking for an upgrade was really awesome

06:39.380 --> 06:43.700
I I just want to give a huge shout out to the writers huge shout out to the lab

06:43.780 --> 06:50.660
I'm actually really really proud of our 40 60 ti review and our our x 7600 review

06:50.820 --> 06:52.180
There are a couple of things we got wrong

06:52.180 --> 06:56.820
I think we had a a table in the 40 60 ti review that said it had a 16x interface

06:56.900 --> 06:58.660
It has an 8x interface

06:58.660 --> 07:01.380
That is a problem if you're upgrading an older platform

07:01.940 --> 07:06.660
On a modern platform. It's not a problem. It doesn't affect the numbers that we showed you guys

07:07.220 --> 07:09.940
But that is something that we we could have gotten a little bit better

07:09.940 --> 07:12.260
And I think there were a couple small things in the 7600 but

07:12.820 --> 07:19.620
Every time we release a new gpu review. We're getting a little bit cleaner about it. It's just it's a lot of moving parts guys

07:20.180 --> 07:21.460
um

07:21.460 --> 07:23.940
But this is one of those things that i'm just looking at going

07:24.740 --> 07:28.500
Give me a reason not to start shadow banning again

07:28.580 --> 07:31.220
Like this is another one that I saw on today's video

07:31.220 --> 07:37.060
It was a short on the billy billy gold play button that we got for reaching a million subscribers on billy billy

07:37.140 --> 07:41.460
Super cool, which is super awesome like huge shout out

07:42.020 --> 07:44.660
Dennis has been deeply involved in that over the years

07:45.300 --> 07:52.260
And he's been involved in that over the years and you know helped foster the community over there our translation team over in china

07:52.820 --> 07:58.580
All the members past and present just shout out all those people for for making this possible

07:59.620 --> 08:01.620
And you know, this is the takeaway

08:02.260 --> 08:08.660
That someone got was not expecting linus to take a knee to china after saying he will never visit because of the ccp

08:09.060 --> 08:11.060
What a hypocrite um

08:11.620 --> 08:16.740
So here's something it actually costs us money to run that chinese channel. I

08:17.380 --> 08:19.860
Because I won't go to china anymore

08:19.940 --> 08:23.860
I have no way of getting any of the ad revenue that we've made from that channel

08:24.420 --> 08:28.340
Out of it out of china. It's all just stuck there. It's just something where

08:29.060 --> 08:32.020
There was a fan group that was translating our videos

08:32.580 --> 08:35.540
Pirating them uploading them to billy billy and we kind of went hey

08:36.580 --> 08:40.980
Please don't do that. But how about this? How about we actually compensate you for it?

08:41.300 --> 08:43.300
And we'll make the whole thing official

08:43.300 --> 08:49.220
And that way we can we can have a proper presence there with translations and and all that good stuff

08:49.300 --> 08:51.300
If it's going to get pirated anyways, we might as well

08:51.780 --> 08:56.660
Do it properly we might as well do it properly and it's just one of those things that I look at and I go

08:57.620 --> 09:00.340
You know, why do I have to read that? Why do I ever?

09:00.900 --> 09:06.740
Whether you're trolling which honestly, I don't think so. I I've got a pretty good radar for it these days

09:07.460 --> 09:10.020
No, some people actually are that brain dead

09:10.420 --> 09:14.980
Um, so whether you're trolling if you are or whether your takes are just that bad

09:16.340 --> 09:18.900
I just uh, I used to care about this a lot

09:19.780 --> 09:22.660
Like shadow banning. Yeah, like thinking it was a bad thing. Yeah

09:23.380 --> 09:26.900
And then what happened? Is it just because I send you even sort of anymore?

09:27.140 --> 09:33.940
Like I'm actually completely on the other side now and this might piss some people off, but it's just the reality in my opinion

09:34.740 --> 09:40.980
Back when I was a stalwart defender of like you shouldn't ban people the internet was in a bit of a different spot

09:42.340 --> 09:44.340
And now like

09:45.060 --> 09:46.660
I don't know

09:46.660 --> 09:48.660
You you get how many comments every day

09:49.460 --> 09:51.460
And it's like, yeah, I don't know

09:52.420 --> 09:54.420
Is that helping anything? Yeah

09:55.140 --> 10:00.740
Like like actually at all. Is this is this beneficial for anything? Are you gonna change anything?

10:00.820 --> 10:04.740
Is this is any discourse coming from this that is helpful? Yeah, so I've been scrolling. Here's another one

10:04.820 --> 10:06.820
This review was way too lenient

10:06.900 --> 10:13.700
Uh, this card is garbage end of story. It's not garbage. That's just I I don't know what to tell you

10:14.100 --> 10:16.100
It's not garbage. I feel like

10:16.980 --> 10:19.940
I feel like people have gotten kind of a twisted

10:20.900 --> 10:25.780
Uh, like a twisted perception of what garbage is

10:26.820 --> 10:34.180
At the right price it it does it do you plug it into your computer and does it shard fps onto your monitor?

10:34.980 --> 10:36.980
Does it do so without overheating?

10:37.620 --> 10:39.620
Uh, without causing blue screens

10:40.100 --> 10:44.180
Does it does it harm your dog? You know, like is it is it bad?

10:45.220 --> 10:46.180
No

10:46.260 --> 10:53.940
It's overpriced. It's not worth it. That's its problem. Yeah, Nvidia is marketing a 50 series card as a 60

10:54.340 --> 10:58.580
Ti card and that's a problem and pricing it as such. Yeah, and that's a problem

10:59.540 --> 11:02.660
But it doesn't make it garbage. It makes it

11:03.700 --> 11:09.380
Overpriced like if you found it and it was that card and it was on a mad discount. Yeah, maybe it's all right

11:10.020 --> 11:11.220
Absolutely

11:11.300 --> 11:17.380
And happy 45 34 says no criticism allowed on ltt videos. I guess anything bad the shadow venue. Let's see. That's not true at all

11:17.940 --> 11:22.020
Um, you know, we have no problem. We have no problem with constructive criticism

11:22.740 --> 11:26.900
What it is is I just I don't disingenuous arguments, uh starting to

11:27.540 --> 11:31.220
Trying to start things just for the sake of trying to start things like I don't know. Yeah

11:32.820 --> 11:34.820
I just I I just can't

11:35.460 --> 11:43.540
And oh man, I we've actually got a video coming where I I kind of I kind of lean into this. I was having some fun with it

11:43.940 --> 11:46.820
Um, I I kind of brought back the scrapyard war spirit though

11:47.940 --> 11:52.660
So everyone's getting kind of you know mad at me for not going hard enough on nvidia

11:52.660 --> 11:56.180
And I shouldn't say everyone I mean the like dislike ratio on that video is still about 92

11:56.740 --> 12:02.660
93 percent or something like that it might even be higher now because it tends to be that it's that initial rush of people

12:02.660 --> 12:07.700
Like the really hardcore tech people that are like this this review wasn't critical enough or whatever the case may be

12:08.020 --> 12:12.980
But the number of people that are mad at me for not going hard enough at nvidia is if I have

12:13.540 --> 12:20.260
Any kind of influence whatsoever on nvidia's it's just comical to me at this point. So I wrote up a little intro

12:20.660 --> 12:22.660
um because

12:22.660 --> 12:24.660
I wanted to address that right

12:24.820 --> 12:30.580
So it kind of it kind of goes along lines of like are you tired of gpu manufacturers screwing over your wallet?

12:31.140 --> 12:33.700
Well, it's time to take action here

12:33.940 --> 12:35.140
Let me show you what to do

12:35.140 --> 12:38.580
And I kind of do a little flourish with my wallet and put it in my pocket

12:38.900 --> 12:41.300
And then do you remember the windows 3.1 sound that's like

12:45.060 --> 12:47.060
I did it I didn't open it

12:47.460 --> 12:54.340
Then I worked with nicole from the uh from the editing team to there's this really cool transition that we can do

12:54.660 --> 12:56.660
Where if you do a whip pan

12:56.820 --> 13:04.340
And then a whip pan back you can use two completely different shots as long as that blur is of approximately the same things

13:04.820 --> 13:08.260
So it actually whips away from me to me

13:08.820 --> 13:13.940
Standing in the studio, and I'm like your performative boycott means nothing

13:14.260 --> 13:20.100
You have more than enough gpu's for like I basically get to be my own. Yeah, yeah, like peanut gallery

13:20.820 --> 13:25.620
Yeah, your performative boycott means nothing blah blah you're anyway, um

13:26.740 --> 13:32.580
And and I'm like and then it like whips back to me and it was a really fun video because

13:33.060 --> 13:39.620
I basically went scrapyard worth shopping and showed that you can get a sick system upgrade for a great

13:39.940 --> 13:46.100
Price right now. Is it getting better and not given video or amd any money. In fact, cool. I had so much fun

13:49.300 --> 13:51.300
That I'm kind of thinking

13:51.700 --> 13:52.820
Oh

13:52.820 --> 13:58.260
We might have to bring it back. No way. I think we might have to it was so fun

13:58.900 --> 14:05.140
Man, I we're back boys. Let's go. I basically said I set a budget for myself

14:05.860 --> 14:09.540
um, all right, I set a budget for myself of

14:10.420 --> 14:13.860
Approximately the price of a hydrate 40 60 ti

14:14.420 --> 14:20.100
Okay, I managed to beat it by about 30 percent while still saving like 20 bucks

14:20.660 --> 14:24.180
Oh performance beat it by 30. Oh, yeah, and saved. Oh, yeah

14:24.660 --> 14:31.220
Scaring out wars. Oh, that's the best and I have almost a year of warranty on the card. I got you

14:33.540 --> 14:35.540
Okay, what could go wrong?

14:36.340 --> 14:41.380
That's sick. I won and won and won some more and I got a video out of it, which is winning four times

14:41.380 --> 14:45.620
That's another that's a win. Yeah, exactly. And so I'm looking at it going like

14:46.580 --> 14:50.580
Oh, yeah, yeah, we got another comment over here on the 40. You must have been paid to review this card

14:51.140 --> 14:57.780
People like that clearly have no idea what it's like to work with a brand on a paid promotion

14:58.420 --> 15:02.820
You do. Yeah, would you be allowed to open with a sarcastic? No

15:03.140 --> 15:08.740
Oh, thank you Nvidia for at least not taking away any VRAM. No

15:09.540 --> 15:11.060
Not even sort of

15:11.060 --> 15:13.060
You sure? Yeah, are you sure?

15:13.140 --> 15:15.140
Dude, because it seems like you would be able to

15:16.340 --> 15:18.340
Based on some of the comments. Yeah

15:18.580 --> 15:23.860
I wonder how much here's another one right here. We've had stuff kick back for like a lot less than that. This is this is great

15:24.260 --> 15:25.380
Uh

15:25.380 --> 15:31.300
Hold on. Hold on. Where did it go? Must have been must have been paid super cool excellent smart comment

15:31.540 --> 15:33.300
Wonder how much they paid

15:33.300 --> 15:37.140
This video doesn't feel so honest, but I get it from a business perspective

15:37.780 --> 15:39.780
No

15:39.780 --> 15:42.500
You actually don't you get nothing

15:43.860 --> 15:45.860
You missed the whole thing

15:46.420 --> 15:48.420
Whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh

15:49.060 --> 15:50.420
um

15:50.420 --> 15:51.780
Yeah, I don't know

15:51.780 --> 15:52.820
I just

15:52.820 --> 15:53.860
Anyway

15:53.860 --> 15:59.540
Massive massive shout out the team really really happy with those reviews really excited for the direction the lab is going

15:59.940 --> 16:04.340
We've had some really cool and exciting meetings lately with the team over there

16:04.420 --> 16:08.500
I think we're going to be ready to roll out some of the category specific channels

16:08.980 --> 16:12.580
Because I think I've talked about this on the wan show before but one of the

16:13.060 --> 16:14.580
One of the

16:14.580 --> 16:22.420
Directions that I see online content going is I see mega channels like the mkb hd's and

16:23.060 --> 16:25.220
Ltt's actually even to a lesser degree

16:25.860 --> 16:32.580
Marquez because he is kind of niche focused a little bit more focused especially now that he's split cars off of mkb hd onto

16:33.940 --> 16:35.940
autofocus. Yeah, it's kind of

16:37.940 --> 16:40.900
Mobile devices and consumer electronics

16:41.460 --> 16:48.340
It's so it's relatively narrowly focused right compared to ours whereas we are as broad as okay this week

16:48.820 --> 16:52.660
Uh, what is this thing powered by something this week?

16:52.740 --> 16:59.300
We uploaded a tour of asml who makes the lithography machines that

17:01.460 --> 17:08.020
Help manufacturers like intel and tsmc produced the world's most cutting-edge microchips

17:08.740 --> 17:12.900
So like super super deep technical video and then we also

17:13.540 --> 17:18.900
Built a silly hundred thousand dollar computer for playing minecraft and water cooled to bed

17:19.460 --> 17:26.500
I basically did a youtuber video where I talked about you know, what's going on in my personal life and my job role changed like

17:27.140 --> 17:30.500
We are all over the map reviews of a couple gpus

17:31.140 --> 17:37.460
So the way that I see it it's going to be much much harder to attract a loyal audience to a channel and therefore

17:38.100 --> 17:44.820
Alloy a lot against for a channel unless you're focused and the way that I see it if you have a power supply focused channel

17:44.980 --> 17:46.580
You're going to get two different viewers for that

17:46.580 --> 17:50.980
You're going to get people who really want to stay up on what's going on in power supplies

17:51.700 --> 17:53.700
And then you're going to get people who

17:54.500 --> 17:58.900
Haven't cared about a power supply in six years, but they're building a new computer and they're going

18:00.340 --> 18:02.340
Sorry 16 pin what?

18:03.460 --> 18:05.060
What's

18:05.060 --> 18:09.380
I don't care. Just tell me a good one, right? So you're going to get a lot of those our goal

18:10.820 --> 18:16.100
Our goal for a power supply specific channel will be and I you guys can quote me on this

18:16.660 --> 18:19.460
To have a video for every power supply

18:23.300 --> 18:25.300
Like every new one that comes out

18:25.860 --> 18:28.980
Well, we're going to have to work. Are you including server ones the bat catalog too

18:29.860 --> 18:32.100
No, okay. No like atx

18:32.580 --> 18:39.060
Atx money money and doing server ones there could but I mean almost nobody builds a server anymore

18:39.220 --> 18:44.900
Ah, yeah, fair enough. It's almost exclusively bare bones and I could I could see us having a more enterprise

18:45.540 --> 18:47.540
it sort of

18:47.860 --> 18:51.300
Focus channel at some point maybe not that where we would look at bare bones servers

18:51.460 --> 18:54.180
Yeah, look at these at these platforms as a whole

18:54.500 --> 19:01.220
But that would be something that would come later and it would be more along the lines of how we would test something like laptops laptops

19:02.020 --> 19:07.540
Oh, man laptops are deep to cover a laptop properly

19:08.020 --> 19:11.460
You have to have your methodologies down for everything

19:11.940 --> 19:15.220
Battery testing screen testing keyboard testing

19:15.700 --> 19:21.540
Uh processor testing. Oh, don't forget that you're going to have to account for different environmental factors

19:21.940 --> 19:27.140
Uh, don't forget that you need to test it in different power profiles depending on whether it's plugged in or unplugged

19:27.780 --> 19:33.700
Laptops are going to take some time. Oh, yeah, right and don't forget that per model per chassis

19:33.780 --> 19:37.380
They're available and I don't know about 25 different configurations

19:38.020 --> 19:40.020
um, I

19:40.500 --> 19:46.340
Do you remember when I optimistically bought one of every config of the m1 MacBook thinking, okay

19:46.660 --> 19:50.660
We're going to get like our laptop methodology down and we're going to be the

19:51.460 --> 19:53.460
outlet that actually can tell you

19:54.420 --> 19:57.620
Exactly which configuration to buy like bang for the buck

19:57.700 --> 20:02.980
And then they basically all got deployed to people who wanted MacBooks internally and scattered to the high winds

20:03.460 --> 20:05.460
Yeah, that was a good investment

20:07.780 --> 20:14.420
Anywho the idea is that eventually we're going to get there and then all the ones that we don't need anymore

20:14.500 --> 20:20.420
We'll just divest ourselves of by flipping them at lttstore.com or on ebay or whatever. We'll figure all that out

20:21.780 --> 20:23.060
um

20:23.060 --> 20:28.500
It's time for us to jump into our next topic here apparently dan is not going to let me talk about haters anymore

20:29.140 --> 20:31.620
Do you want can we talk about this the sony thing?

20:32.420 --> 20:38.980
Yeah, sony ps5 announcements at the their playstation showcase sony announced their new handheld

20:39.380 --> 20:47.060
Uh projected to come out later this year called project q the handheld allows remote play of ps5 games via wi-fi

20:47.300 --> 20:51.220
At up to 1080p and 60 fps it has an eight inch lcd screen

20:51.460 --> 20:57.460
They have no idea how much it will cost and it's unclear whether it will do anything else other than stream ps5 games

20:57.620 --> 21:03.780
Or whether it will be able to use cellular networks considering they specified wi-fi. I kind of doubt it, but we'll see

21:03.940 --> 21:07.780
Yeah, that's one of those things where the answer is no. Yeah

21:08.740 --> 21:10.980
Also lossless wireless earbuds

21:11.940 --> 21:13.140
Okay

21:13.220 --> 21:20.100
The playstation showcase also highlighted a number of upcoming games sony announced slash showed off several standard ps5 games

21:20.340 --> 21:23.220
The only notable exclusive being spider-man 2

21:24.340 --> 21:31.220
Okay, some notable not exclusives a remake of meadow metal gear 3 a reboot of bungee's marathon series. That's

21:32.020 --> 21:38.020
I know right sony owning bungee just makes my brain hurt. Yeah, but it's non-exclusive

21:38.820 --> 21:43.940
Which is also the whole thing is just like uh, it's weird, but maybe really cool

21:44.100 --> 21:47.780
I haven't been able to look into uh any of that yet because I had a very busy week

21:47.780 --> 21:56.420
But I'm pretty interested in the idea of them rebooting marathon. We'll see um allen wake 2 a splatoon alike called foam stars

21:56.900 --> 22:00.420
And the one riley is most excited about the tallows principal 2

22:00.740 --> 22:04.740
I think quite a few people are gonna be excited about that. It's a pvp extraction shooter

22:08.020 --> 22:15.060
Oh, I think you've got his attention. Oh my bungee making a pvp extraction shooter is extremely exciting

22:15.780 --> 22:17.780
Like the division. Okay that part

22:18.580 --> 22:21.620
Makes it a lot worse. Okay. Hopefully it's not like the division at all

22:22.340 --> 22:26.900
The division was terrible in my opinion, but I know I'm sure someone liked it. Okay

22:27.300 --> 22:30.580
I want to talk about this wireless console thing

22:31.380 --> 22:33.380
Is it just me?

22:33.700 --> 22:35.140
Or

22:35.140 --> 22:37.140
Like very little use for this

22:38.100 --> 22:42.980
Don't use play on your tv. You know, I don't know how to feel about this. Okay. So first of all here

22:42.980 --> 22:46.580
Let's flip over to my laptop. This is this is apparently what it's gonna look like

22:47.540 --> 22:49.540
I think it looks cool

22:49.780 --> 22:54.420
Yeah, it looks actually looks like it's probably comfortable to hold and stuff too. Here's my problem

22:54.740 --> 22:59.700
I don't know how to feel about this because I've been kind of all over the place. Yeah

23:00.260 --> 23:01.380
I

23:01.380 --> 23:07.860
Loved the nvidia shield. Yes, and yes android games did exist that could be played with a controller

23:08.100 --> 23:11.620
But at the time they were way less common. So it was

23:12.580 --> 23:14.340
fundamentally

23:14.340 --> 23:17.780
Only a device for streaming your gaming pc to a handheld

23:18.420 --> 23:20.420
form factor and I was

23:20.580 --> 23:26.580
Crazy in love with that thing. It was it was how I played games when I had infant children because

23:26.980 --> 23:31.140
It basically had the kid kind of in the thing in your arms and you could play video games

23:31.140 --> 23:34.580
There was no way you could sit at a computer. So that was it. That was how I could play video games

23:35.220 --> 23:37.220
loved that and then

23:38.020 --> 23:40.180
You know, I was less bullish on the steam link

23:40.580 --> 23:46.820
Which is basically the same idea except that it allows you to play your gaming pc games on your tv

23:47.220 --> 23:53.380
With a steam controller or some other controller or whatever else and then I'm trying to think of kind of what came

23:53.540 --> 23:58.100
What came next here? I never really used the nvidia shield the console for that for that function

23:58.180 --> 24:02.980
It just didn't really appeal to me and then when logitech, okay

24:03.620 --> 24:08.900
When logitech announced the gcloud, I was looking at it going. Well, this is just kind of stupid

24:09.460 --> 24:15.220
Because you could get a steam deck for like a hundred dollars more that actually has a full computer in it

24:15.620 --> 24:20.660
But then I reviewed the gcloud and even though I was a certified hater of the thing

24:21.780 --> 24:26.820
I actually really liked it. Like I really liked it. I've got nothing against the concept of this

24:26.900 --> 24:30.820
I'm a little bit concerned about what I expect the price might be then there's the we you

24:31.140 --> 24:36.980
Did you ever use the wireless controller pad function of the we you did you ever even look at that screen? Yeah

24:37.620 --> 24:40.660
Really? I I am a I am a rare pikachu

24:41.220 --> 24:42.580
We you

24:42.580 --> 24:49.060
Enjoyer. I really liked the we you. I was I actually genuinely very much like the we you I even

24:49.700 --> 24:56.580
Loved okay, so the super mario bros whatever it was that came out for the we you new super mario brothers

24:56.660 --> 25:00.580
We you it had a four player co-op feature yes, it did with

25:01.460 --> 25:03.460
a fifth person

25:04.180 --> 25:10.740
That used that main controller had their own screen and you could put down like emergency platforms for your teammates

25:10.900 --> 25:15.300
You could also troll them by while they're like mid jump put a platform right in front of them

25:15.300 --> 25:20.180
And they smack into it and fall down you could like try to fight your own team from actually completing the level and all

25:20.260 --> 25:22.260
Stuff extremely fun

25:23.380 --> 25:28.260
That's very fun. That's very unique experience too. That's fair and very fun

25:28.580 --> 25:31.060
I played a bunch of different games on the we you they're all really good

25:31.300 --> 25:34.420
I am deeply convinced that the only reason why the we you didn't do well

25:34.900 --> 25:36.900
Was because no one knew

25:37.380 --> 25:41.060
That a it existed or b what the hell it even was

25:41.940 --> 25:45.060
My group of relatively techie friends when I first bought it

25:45.060 --> 25:49.780
I invited them all over because I wanted to play the five person super mario bros thing

25:50.180 --> 25:53.700
Or uh, yeah, super mario. Yeah, um, all of them

25:54.660 --> 25:58.100
Literally all of them thought that I bought some expansion for my we

25:59.220 --> 26:01.540
None of them knew that it was a dedicated console swedish made

26:03.060 --> 26:09.060
What did I say did I say something wrong? No, no, you just an expansion for your we I'm asking if it's swedish made

26:12.660 --> 26:19.060
But yeah, I don't know I I I really enjoyed the we you and that controller one is very is his bag, baby

26:20.420 --> 26:22.420
That

26:23.940 --> 26:28.980
That controller that controller was actually very comfortable. That's true. Yeah. Yep. It's true

26:29.380 --> 26:35.860
Like more comfortable than the switches by a lot in my opinion. Okay. Um, I do want to keep talking about this paradigm though

26:36.420 --> 26:41.460
Because I had another opportunity to look at a device that's basically this

26:42.100 --> 26:44.100
And I have to confess

26:44.820 --> 26:47.620
I kind of blew them off because I just

26:48.580 --> 26:50.420
Didn't really care

26:50.420 --> 26:56.980
Uh, yeah, you always expect it to suck and then it's actually okay. Well, no, it's not that because I was so jazzed on the shield

26:57.380 --> 27:01.220
Right. So here hold on a second. I'm just gonna jump back over to my laptop for a second here

27:01.780 --> 27:07.780
This is from peak dough of all people. I remember remember these guys. They had the this like low latency

27:08.660 --> 27:12.980
Uh hdmi streaming thing. Uh, so it's millimeter wave

27:13.540 --> 27:20.340
Which is a problem because that means the range is going to be pretty fubar but 60p or 1080 60p

27:20.420 --> 27:22.420
so 60 hertz and

27:23.060 --> 27:24.820
the the pitched

27:24.820 --> 27:27.540
Sort of the pitched sort of use case for this thing

27:28.100 --> 27:31.220
Was actually streaming your playstation 5 to it

27:31.780 --> 27:34.500
Compatible of pc playstation xbox windows switch

27:34.900 --> 27:40.980
Etc two and a half milliseconds delay up to 30 meters or whatever and three hour battery life

27:41.620 --> 27:43.620
And I kind of looked at this and I went

27:46.660 --> 27:48.660
That seems really niche

27:49.620 --> 27:51.620
What and it's sony

27:51.780 --> 27:54.740
Just laid down a big fat

27:56.100 --> 28:01.220
I think you're wrong linus. Yeah, because they are releasing a first party accessory

28:01.700 --> 28:03.060
That's just

28:03.060 --> 28:05.060
this

28:06.660 --> 28:08.980
If this thing could work over cell networks, it would be sick

28:09.540 --> 28:14.260
It doesn't it. I know it doesn't you don't want see people keep asking for this

28:14.900 --> 28:18.580
You don't want to game over a cellular network. Yeah fair enough. Yeah, and

28:19.540 --> 28:23.220
Okay, I I know games would be I know I hear you

28:23.620 --> 28:31.540
I can actually hear your keys heating up as you furiously type a message about how much you love using moonlight

28:31.940 --> 28:33.940
Over a cell network or whatever

28:34.260 --> 28:36.260
Steam link

28:36.260 --> 28:41.060
I know there are certain types of games you want to play like a puzzle game or something

28:41.940 --> 28:45.060
No problem by all means play over a cellular network

28:45.460 --> 28:50.980
But wherever you live a your cell network must be a lot better than mine. So maybe you're in like

28:51.780 --> 28:56.020
Tokyo or you're in like soul or something like that. Yeah, sure fine

28:56.420 --> 28:58.580
A your cell network is a lot better than mine

28:59.060 --> 28:59.940
B

28:59.940 --> 29:05.540
You must have a really great data plan. Both of those things are true in a lot of places in the world

29:05.780 --> 29:07.780
Absolutely house internets off cell

29:08.020 --> 29:09.620
absolutely

29:09.620 --> 29:16.500
However, even under those ideal conditions, there are certain genres of games that are just not going to be fun with the additional latency

29:17.300 --> 29:22.020
And I just I wouldn't I wouldn't compromise on that. I just wouldn't

29:22.660 --> 29:25.620
Um, I I I love what sony's doing right now though

29:26.260 --> 29:28.660
PSVR2 is awesome. Yeah

29:29.540 --> 29:30.820
This

29:30.820 --> 29:37.460
I don't know if it's awesome. It looks cool, but it's cool. Yeah, it's different. Yeah, it's not just I am a hundred percent certain

29:37.780 --> 29:42.020
While it's not necessarily for me that some people will love this thing like Microsoft

29:43.700 --> 29:50.740
How how hard have they lost this generation of gaming at this point you you could play PlayStation games in the bath

29:51.780 --> 29:53.460
Yeah

29:53.460 --> 29:58.500
I could that's pretty sweet. I won't but I could but it's because not necessarily a hundred percent for you, but

29:59.540 --> 30:01.540
Someone could fit that use case

30:01.620 --> 30:06.900
That's pretty cool. I I do I do wonder and conrad's echoing this in the in the chat

30:08.100 --> 30:12.020
How much is it going to cost them not announcing a price is like a little sus

30:14.020 --> 30:16.580
It is it is a it is a wee wee bit sus

30:17.620 --> 30:21.540
I think it's not I think it's not going to be cheap. I mean here here. You know what?

30:21.940 --> 30:27.220
I I can get you pricing for that peak dough thing because realistically, it's the same same hardware

30:28.020 --> 30:29.700
Um, you know what?

30:29.700 --> 30:33.780
I don't know if I ever got a final price because I think it was a kickstarter or something right

30:33.780 --> 30:37.220
That was one of the other reasons that we didn't cover it. I don't I don't like

30:37.860 --> 30:43.620
Covering kick starters speaking of which we should talk about that sponsor spot fail this week on tech wiki

30:43.620 --> 30:46.020
I'll we'll address that a little bit later. Don't let me forget

30:46.740 --> 30:49.780
Um, no, I don't have I don't have a price for this thing

30:49.860 --> 30:53.060
So if I had to guess I'd say it'll probably be similar to the gcloud

30:53.540 --> 30:59.220
So in the 250 250 us to 299 I think this is going to be a very expensive accessory

30:59.300 --> 31:05.060
But again, I do think some people will eat that but that's something that sony has demonstrated that they're

31:05.700 --> 31:07.700
totally willing to do

31:07.700 --> 31:12.340
I mean the playstation fr2 is an accessory that costs as much as the bloody console. Yeah

31:13.060 --> 31:16.420
Like okay, it's not that's not cheap by

31:17.140 --> 31:18.500
any means

31:18.500 --> 31:19.780
at all

31:19.780 --> 31:21.780
but like

31:22.180 --> 31:30.900
It's not it's not 700 bucks because it's not dedicated handheld. Yeah, you're not you're not buying a you're not you're not buying an accessory

31:30.900 --> 31:38.500
You're buying a completely different experience. Yeah, and yeah, that's something that sony has done a really good job of here

31:38.980 --> 31:44.740
is creating different experiences and it's not going to have quite the mobility of the switch but

31:45.700 --> 31:47.700
Man, I gotta

31:48.340 --> 31:52.980
I've got to take a moment and just appreciate how crap the switch is these days

31:53.940 --> 32:00.180
I own a switch OLED a top of the line. It's old now switch if you will and

32:00.740 --> 32:06.580
I own tears of the kingdom you guys saw my copy that I bought on the short circuit

32:07.220 --> 32:09.220
and I am currently in the process

32:09.700 --> 32:11.700
of getting my

32:11.780 --> 32:18.980
My yuzu all set up for the trip that luke and I are going on so that I can start tears of the kingdom on a platform that doesn't suck

32:19.620 --> 32:20.340
Yeah

32:20.340 --> 32:22.340
Yeah, the switch is over six years old

32:22.900 --> 32:25.940
Yeah, and it was garbage when it came out. That's the worst part by the way

32:26.340 --> 32:33.860
Jake Jake from the lab is is talking in the float plane chat about what I said about cellular networks and and game streaming

32:34.100 --> 32:39.060
And he's like, yeah, the problem is not how many gigabits per second or whatever you can get in the speed test

32:39.380 --> 32:42.740
The problem is that this is real-time data and latency matters

32:43.060 --> 32:46.260
And so if anything arrives even ever so slightly out of order

32:46.260 --> 32:52.820
It's going to be garbled and that's something you simply can't control on a cellular network. It's extremely challenging

32:53.620 --> 32:55.060
um

32:55.060 --> 33:01.140
And yeah, yeah people are talking about like what what ping time I get or how many megabits I get that that is not the point

33:01.620 --> 33:06.580
It's just a very very even though it feels the same to us. It's the same thing with frame times

33:06.900 --> 33:12.820
Yeah, I click link and page load. It feels the same to us, but it's a really different technology

33:15.940 --> 33:16.660
Yep, yep, yep

33:16.660 --> 33:17.140
All right

33:17.140 --> 33:19.620
It's time for us to explain merch messages

33:19.940 --> 33:24.180
If you want to send a message into the show the way to do it is with the merch message

33:24.180 --> 33:30.420
Hey, look g or g just scored an insulated water bottle 64 ounce at lttstore.com

33:30.980 --> 33:32.980
When you're in the checkout you can send

33:33.940 --> 33:39.940
When you're in the cart you can send a merch message and our producer dan will try to respond to it

33:40.020 --> 33:42.900
It's going to be a bit of a shorter show today because luke and I have to catch a flight

33:42.900 --> 33:44.900
we'll talk about that in a little bit and

33:45.460 --> 33:51.060
So our producer dan might respond to it. He might just put it up on the bottom and if there's no replies, uh

33:52.100 --> 33:57.700
Who knows maybe chat can help reply to your merch message. We might need some help from you guys today

33:58.420 --> 34:05.140
Or dan is going to curate some of them for me and luke to address later on during when show after dark

34:05.540 --> 34:10.820
Since we're talking about what's going on on the store. Why don't we tell you guys about a couple of new items?

34:12.340 --> 34:14.340
Uh, I don't see them in the thing here

34:15.220 --> 34:22.820
Yes, I do see them in the thing here. We just launched our premium joggers. Who is this with that drip?

34:23.700 --> 34:25.700
It's got to be like bellavance or something. Oh, no

34:26.420 --> 34:31.300
Whoever it is. They've got the swag stance going on. Definitely got the swag stance

34:33.060 --> 34:39.940
Um, these are super nice by the way got them in two different colors. Oh my gosh. They have to check these out black and olive

34:41.380 --> 34:45.780
Man love this great pose. I do want some some joggers. Sammy

34:46.260 --> 34:51.460
There there's sammy. He gets the poses man. Yeah colton. He tries colton doesn't

34:53.060 --> 34:55.060
We've got contrast going on

34:56.020 --> 34:58.020
Solid solid effort

34:58.660 --> 35:03.460
Yeah, fantastic. Yeah, these are these are super nice. Oh, look at this. What a nice write up

35:03.460 --> 35:07.220
You know how we've talked about how we like don't do a good enough job sometimes

35:07.780 --> 35:10.900
Let's go made of a hundred percent recycled polyester

35:11.700 --> 35:12.740
sick

35:12.740 --> 35:18.100
Very cool. Uh, we also launched one other product this week that you guys are going to want to check out

35:18.900 --> 35:24.340
I wouldn't necessarily wear these two together, but uh, you know, hey, you can definitely get them both

35:25.140 --> 35:27.140
Very different feel

35:27.220 --> 35:31.220
But we've had a lot of people ask us for stuff that they can wear to work

35:32.020 --> 35:36.580
That still matches the comfort that they know and love from our other products

35:36.660 --> 35:39.620
But that is workplace workplace ready colton

35:41.860 --> 35:46.020
F***ing really I swear I've seen him do exactly that. I don't know why

35:46.740 --> 35:53.940
Yeah, but like I've seen him do that. Why does colton do anything he does? I don't know. Anyway, it's available in green and

35:54.420 --> 35:56.420
charcoal melange

35:56.740 --> 35:58.740
Super comfy and

35:59.780 --> 36:04.900
Okay, who wrote these this shirt is softer than a freshly pixelated kittens fur

36:08.020 --> 36:14.260
What pixelated kittens, what does that even mean I have no idea but it is it is comfy

36:16.020 --> 36:19.860
It's interesting it probably would get people to keep reading so maybe it's good

36:20.340 --> 36:23.540
The joggers are available in two colors and two lengths

36:24.740 --> 36:27.940
And the polo shirt is available in two different colors. Oh

36:28.660 --> 36:31.940
Now seems like as good a time as any to talk about

36:32.660 --> 36:34.660
LTT is hiring

36:34.740 --> 36:39.860
Ah, yes, wait, I'm supposed to show the jobs page and I am also I'll do the reading

36:40.020 --> 36:46.740

37:57.220 --> 38:02.500
I got there the an eye for details took me a second. How are we hiring so many things right now?

38:03.780 --> 38:06.100
What is a project manager float plane luke?

38:06.740 --> 38:10.420
Huh, what's a project manager? What is this? It's a projector

38:10.900 --> 38:14.660
Man and manager. Okay. Thanks gary key. Yeah, no worries

38:15.540 --> 38:16.660
Okay

38:16.660 --> 38:23.460
We're closing the back end one. I finished writing that contract today accounting just needs to sign it off. We're closing that position. Let's go

38:24.020 --> 38:27.620
um, the project manager one is probably going to go away as well

38:28.020 --> 38:29.140
oh

38:29.140 --> 38:30.340
and

38:30.340 --> 38:35.780
But not because I found someone just because it's not really working you give up. Yeah, uh, well, hey, I

38:36.660 --> 38:41.620
There's time I guess. Oh wait, there is going to be probably we're looking through current applicants

38:42.500 --> 38:49.940
But if the that doesn't work out, um, we might be making another posting for a front end position for float plane as well. All right. Yeah

38:51.460 --> 38:56.980
How are we still okay? We need to take a little break at some minor pre budgeted and haven't budgeted for a while

38:56.980 --> 39:00.740
I know I know mine are mine are good. We might alone. I need mine

39:01.620 --> 39:06.020
Why don't we do a couple merge messages dan hit us sure thing?

39:06.740 --> 39:09.780
Hello l lnd with the end

39:10.500 --> 39:18.820
Or near the end of morse law. How do you expect to see continued generational performance improvement as the transistors can no longer shrink?

39:21.220 --> 39:23.220
um

39:24.340 --> 39:26.340
You know

39:30.740 --> 39:32.740
It seems impossible

39:33.060 --> 39:39.220
But they keep doing it. Yeah, they keep finding some lever to turn some wheel to crank. Yeah, ipc improvements

39:39.860 --> 39:46.340
Yeah, like there's there's things that 3d stacking. Oh, yeah looks like it is going to be one huge

39:47.140 --> 39:51.940
Chipplets look like they are going to be huge not might find other ways

39:52.740 --> 39:59.140
To expand the amount that you're using. Yeah, necessarily the amount we can fit in a certain area like, uh, okay technology

39:59.220 --> 40:03.700
Like in intel's foveros chip where they've got I I forget it's like

40:04.180 --> 40:12.420
Three or four different manufacturing processes and all these buses that are communicating with each other on this like giant package

40:12.900 --> 40:13.780
um

40:13.780 --> 40:21.540
Stuff like stuff like that is going to make its way to consumer technology or to consumer electronics at some point and

40:23.860 --> 40:24.900
Could be a game changer

40:24.900 --> 40:30.980
I mean the way that the way that the way that ai is changing the game too is massive

40:31.940 --> 40:36.820
I think that we are super mad about nvidia giving us

40:37.940 --> 40:42.020
Underpowered gaming chips at a price that isn't palatable right now

40:42.580 --> 40:44.580
But when we look back

40:44.580 --> 40:51.780
So 10 years from now when we're playing photo realistic games at, you know, 300 frames per second or whatever

40:52.180 --> 40:58.260
On chips that fundamentally haven't changed nearly as much as the 10 years prior

40:58.900 --> 41:01.140
We're going to be looking at it going. Wow

41:01.940 --> 41:04.180
They were way ahead and that was

41:04.980 --> 41:06.980
early teething pain

41:07.060 --> 41:10.020
For what was ultimately going to be the future. Um

41:11.380 --> 41:15.700
I mean just just looking at the way that uh, man, I was I was looking at, um

41:16.580 --> 41:18.020
Oh

41:18.020 --> 41:23.860
This new photoshop feature where you basically just give it an image and then just

41:24.420 --> 41:26.580
Tell it like, oh, yeah, I want a lake in the middle

41:26.580 --> 41:30.580
Yeah, and I want a car and I want a cloud that's shaped like the car you saw the same article

41:30.580 --> 41:36.340
I did I think I was I meant to send it to our our thumbnail designer, but I forgot. Yeah, um, I'm sure there already

41:36.340 --> 41:40.900
So photoshop just has generative ai built in and if we're doing that in photoshop now

41:41.700 --> 41:45.380
Then give it a little bit more time and we'll be doing that in real time in games

41:45.700 --> 41:49.780
You know, you'll be able to mod a game by simply typing in a prompt

41:50.580 --> 41:58.740
Okay, I want to play super mario world, but all of the all of the koopas are procedurally generated games are going to be a

41:58.740 --> 42:04.980
Whole little faces with mustaches ball wax like that's insane. I don't think I've even thought about that before

42:05.380 --> 42:08.740
Yeah procedurally generated games don't have to pre-make the assets

42:09.300 --> 42:10.420
Yeah

42:10.420 --> 42:14.900
It's just like I want to play half-life too, but all the opponents are donkeys

42:15.780 --> 42:17.780
And you know what it's not going to be perfect

42:18.740 --> 42:20.740
But it's going to get

42:20.740 --> 42:25.620
Pretty good like you can hugely simplify the modding scene for certain things

42:25.620 --> 42:30.020
You know when they make like they made all the dragons in skyrim into thomas the tank engine or whatever

42:30.500 --> 42:34.260
I didn't see that, but I love it. That's my favorite. Oh, yeah, it's a fantastic

42:35.300 --> 42:40.980
They even like when they fly when they fly in you normally hear the dragon roar they they have a train

42:41.380 --> 42:43.380
Or

42:43.700 --> 42:50.020
It's very good. It's very good. Um, but you could do stuff like that using this instead. Oh, did you find it?

42:53.220 --> 42:57.540
Do you want do you want sound no no, I don't think sound will be necessary entirely

42:58.580 --> 43:03.860
So it's going to land on top of the tower that you're looking at right now spoilers if you haven't oh come on. It's skyrim

43:05.460 --> 43:07.460
Yeah

43:08.420 --> 43:13.140
Ah, you see it you see it flying around in the background. It's going to slam down

43:19.460 --> 43:22.900
There's people who would uh, they'd be like arachnophobic or whatever

43:22.980 --> 43:28.180
So they would replace all the spiders in the game with like teddy bears or or whatever else to right?

43:28.660 --> 43:34.180
Yeah, um, so yeah, that sort of thing is only going to get easier. Oh, so good, which is great

43:34.980 --> 43:36.980
Yeah

43:37.780 --> 43:39.780
Uh

43:40.100 --> 43:44.340
Oh, man, I would be you know, it'd be really interesting. Oh, man

43:45.380 --> 43:50.180
I wonder if we'll get to the point. You know how we've been waiting for uh, or I have whatever

43:50.660 --> 43:53.060
Um for for sky blivion and more blivion

43:53.700 --> 44:00.900
Or more more skywind. Sorry. There we go, which are it's more wind and oblivion rebuilt in skyrim's engine

44:01.060 --> 44:06.980
Yeah, um with really high resolution textures and all this other kind of stuff because you can do some pretty cool things

44:07.060 --> 44:09.060
It's skyrim's engine even though it's pretty old

44:09.060 --> 44:10.260
um

44:10.260 --> 44:12.260
I think we're going to get to a certain point

44:12.340 --> 44:13.700
eventually

44:13.700 --> 44:17.940
Where because of because like yeah, it's going to have some issues doing this kind of stuff out of nowhere

44:18.180 --> 44:23.460
Creativity problems all that kind of stuff it pulls from something whatever, but you might be able to go like, okay. Here's a game

44:24.420 --> 44:26.980
Here's all the information to have all the local files all that kind of stuff

44:27.140 --> 44:30.740
I want you to recreate this using UE5 or whatever

44:30.980 --> 44:33.860
I want you to recreate this using this other thing. Oh, I see what you mean

44:34.420 --> 44:40.020
Because it's pretty good at like translating. Yeah, right even stuff like rtx remix, uh, you know, okay

44:40.740 --> 44:46.180
Uh, a just ai replace all the light sources with real point light sources

44:46.900 --> 44:53.140
Um, yeah, and then you'll have to go on and tweak it. You'll still have to be a graphic designer or game designer or whatever else

44:54.980 --> 45:01.460
But man, yeah, it's like it's like the the generative ai in photoshop, right? It's not replacing artists

45:01.780 --> 45:05.780
Yeah, we still need an artist to do that all the same people to do all the same stuff

45:05.780 --> 45:07.620
It just make their job easier

45:07.620 --> 45:13.540
Well more realistically it makes it so they have to do more of it, but yeah, because that's what working here is like

45:15.220 --> 45:18.820
There's always going to be stuff to do that. It's never a concern

45:19.940 --> 45:27.380
I mean, that's what that's what work is like luke. Yeah, I don't make the freaking I was reading a uh, I was I was reading an article

45:27.940 --> 45:34.420
They they surveyed a whole thing in a bad way because they surveyed a bunch of gen z and millennial people who have sort of

45:34.900 --> 45:38.580
pioneered this concept of it's called lying flat in china or

45:39.140 --> 45:44.660
Quiet quitting in north america of you know, the their their top priorities being

45:45.060 --> 45:51.140
You know work-life balance as opposed to all these other things and then when they continue asking them questions

45:51.620 --> 45:53.620
They're like, okay, right, but

45:54.500 --> 45:56.660
Is that a is that a thing and they're like no

45:58.340 --> 46:01.380
No, actually, I have a second job hustling because

46:02.660 --> 46:05.060
You're bored. Well, no. No, it's just

46:06.100 --> 46:12.980
Inflations out of control like it's it's not actually feasible. Yeah, like you have to you have to you have to bust your butt

46:13.460 --> 46:16.180
And so it's this sort of aspirational thing

46:16.900 --> 46:18.900
I

46:20.260 --> 46:26.180
I don't know. It's uh, it's a it's a big it's a big challenge. It's one of those things where I feel like we

46:26.900 --> 46:30.820
We do I think a pretty good job of trying to make it so that people

46:32.100 --> 46:34.100
Don't have to work outside. They're 40 hours

46:38.180 --> 46:43.220
Stuff right now by and large the way the world's going right now. It's it's not like that

46:43.940 --> 46:49.460
Um, it's it has shifted from uh from uh from an employee's market to an employer's market

46:49.460 --> 46:55.380
Like looking at what's going on with the big tech firms and the way that they're bringing everyone back to office

46:55.860 --> 46:57.860
cutting perks laying off

46:58.580 --> 47:01.300
Literally thousands sometimes tens of thousands of staff

47:02.260 --> 47:06.980
I watched a video recently of a certain excessively rich person and it was like

47:07.620 --> 47:12.820
How much is a banana if we know something else? That one is really funny. That was really funny very funny

47:12.980 --> 47:16.740
But no, they were like, okay, if we take this person's net wealth in single

47:17.540 --> 47:18.900
American dollar bills

47:18.900 --> 47:22.260
So like one u.s. Dollar because I know a lot of other countries don't have that so making sure you know

47:23.060 --> 47:28.740
And we stacked it like horizontally and try to wrap around the world. Yeah, how many times how far do we get?

47:29.380 --> 47:34.820
You single u.s. Dollar bills like like the width almost. Yeah pressed against each other, right?

47:34.900 --> 47:38.020
You almost make it the whole way around the world. Wow. It's just like

47:38.500 --> 47:45.220
Does this make any sense like I don't know anyways, sorry, we'll get back on the tech topics

47:46.420 --> 47:49.460
Oh, no, I think we're supposed to actually do a couple more merge messages

47:52.580 --> 48:00.260
Ah, give us a merge message anyway. Yeah, come on. Give us a message. This one's from jordan. What's the longest you have ever worked in one shift?

48:02.420 --> 48:06.660
Oh, I mean there was I knew that would get a giggle from luke peanut butter crackers

48:08.500 --> 48:12.740
700 series launch 700 series launch. I'm pretty sure I was awake for like four days

48:14.340 --> 48:18.660
See, I don't know. I've done some pretty I've done some pretty dumb stuff too

48:19.060 --> 48:24.580
It depends on how we define work like we didn't use to classify sitting on a plane as work, but

48:25.620 --> 48:27.620
We apparently do now

48:27.700 --> 48:29.540
um

48:29.540 --> 48:33.700
Yeah, it's it's complicated. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's complicated. Um

48:34.660 --> 48:40.340
But I remember when david and I and uh someone from the business team came with us

48:40.420 --> 48:45.780
I can't remember but we went to and from germany in like 30 hours like doorstep to doorstep

48:46.260 --> 48:49.940
So that wasn't technically one shift, but good gravy

48:50.500 --> 48:55.300
Was that ever intense because that's like an 11 hour flight or something like that or like nine hour flight

48:55.300 --> 49:00.260
I can't remember exactly how long it is. We shot a video on the other side like we like we worked

49:00.980 --> 49:02.980
And then we were back

49:03.780 --> 49:09.540
Those those touch-and-go trips can be pretty exhausting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

49:15.460 --> 49:17.780
I think that trip to germany was probably my worst

49:18.660 --> 49:24.500
The worst recently was what we went through with the uh the channel hijacking though. I think it hasn't been that bad in a while

49:25.220 --> 49:29.940
We try we actually try people are constantly why do you have so many people on staff?

49:30.260 --> 49:33.860
Because we're trying because we are actually we're trying trying. Yeah

49:34.740 --> 49:36.740
Not always easy

49:38.260 --> 49:40.260
This is my this is i'm broken and this

49:41.620 --> 49:44.660
This is my problem because you're like talking about how that's a victory

49:45.140 --> 49:49.540
But for me those are all like my favorite memories. Yeah, but then I have to remember

49:50.100 --> 49:52.100
That that's not normal. That's not realistic

49:53.140 --> 49:56.660
Or that yeah, because I will break so I have to like

49:57.300 --> 50:00.420
But I enjoy those so I kind of like it when it happens sometimes

50:00.580 --> 50:04.020
Yeah, but I don't like it probably shouldn't happen too often or I'll

50:04.820 --> 50:08.820
I'm old now. I can't do that all the time, but I do like you're old. I'm getting there

50:09.620 --> 50:11.620
I'm getting there. I'm starting to feel it

50:12.260 --> 50:18.340
The recovery time from things is getting long. Oh, yeah. Oh, it doesn't get better. That's the main thing that I'm noticing

50:18.500 --> 50:22.980
I'm not a lot else is really that you know, but if I if I go too far

50:23.540 --> 50:25.540
It's like, okay. I need to rest

50:25.940 --> 50:31.540
I'll be like, I'll be good in like a day and then it's like a week passes and I'm like, I'm still feeling it. Yep

50:32.020 --> 50:36.340
Yep. Yeah, it's not it's not gonna get better from here on out. I'll tell you that much

50:36.820 --> 50:38.820
30s rough 35s worse

50:39.220 --> 50:41.220
nice

50:41.460 --> 50:45.220
I uh, I had my badminton training session last night

50:45.780 --> 50:47.780
My Thursday night session

50:48.020 --> 50:54.100
I didn't message you this because luke was messaging me the week prior. I think telling me how much water he drank at one of his things

50:54.660 --> 50:56.340
so in

50:56.340 --> 50:57.700
two

50:57.700 --> 50:59.700
hours and 20 minutes

51:00.020 --> 51:04.260
I drank two and a half of these that is 100 ounces of water

51:05.380 --> 51:07.620
And let me put it this way. I didn't go pee

51:09.620 --> 51:10.900
I am

51:10.900 --> 51:16.100
F***ing annihilated right now. Like I am so sore and so tired

51:16.660 --> 51:20.500
I don't know what he was trying to do to me. I told him I was like, david

51:20.820 --> 51:26.100
I'm going to taiwan to play badminton every day and cover a trade show

51:26.900 --> 51:29.540
Why are we doing all smash practice today?

51:33.060 --> 51:35.620
We've been planning this video for a long time and things just keep coming up

51:35.620 --> 51:40.500
But we'll we will do it where we're gonna go to the gym and I I at no point in time

51:40.580 --> 51:44.660
Have actually known what the like point was or what we're like actually supposed to do

51:45.460 --> 51:50.340
So I've had I've just in my head. I've had these various ideas for like a while

51:50.980 --> 51:52.420
Just different like

51:52.420 --> 51:55.700
Ah, maybe we'll do this. Maybe we'll do that and then eventually I was like, you know

51:55.860 --> 52:00.740
I was hoping this is going to be a recurring thing and it's not going to be so I'm just going to like

52:01.300 --> 52:02.580
hurt him

52:02.580 --> 52:04.580
What I'm just going to make it

52:04.580 --> 52:06.260
so hard

52:06.260 --> 52:09.700
That like he's just going to wake up the next day and not be able to move and then I was like

52:10.980 --> 52:15.220
I like enjoyed this idea and then I was like, no, I can't because like we're too old now

52:15.460 --> 52:19.460
If we were back when we first started doing this that would have probably been fine

52:19.780 --> 52:23.460
Yeah, if this was 10 years ago, we probably would have both been fine

52:23.620 --> 52:25.620
But now if I do that, it's like

52:25.860 --> 52:31.380
Actually going to be a problem and you'd probably make me do it with you. So we'd both just be wrecked for like ever

52:32.660 --> 52:36.660
Okay, well, I can't do that. So back to the drawing board. It's like, all right

52:39.780 --> 52:42.020
All right, why don't we jump into our next topic here?

52:42.180 --> 52:52.420
No one wants to buy the rtx 4060 ti in spite of my best efforts after taking a back alley deal from nvidia to promote their new gpu

52:53.940 --> 52:55.940
slash s

52:58.100 --> 53:03.140
Nvidia's new rtx 4060 ti has been met with low consumer interest many retailers

53:03.700 --> 53:09.140
Only ordered a few cards per store and in some areas, especially europe

53:09.300 --> 53:14.580
They're already offering the cards for 10 to 25 dollars below the recommended retail price

53:14.900 --> 53:20.020
And this is probably because in europe the recommended retail prices are particularly brutal

53:20.420 --> 53:26.100
Because nvidia apparently doesn't attend the xc.com school of how currency conversion works

53:26.580 --> 53:32.420
Um at the same time though nvidia's market valuation increased by 30 percent

53:33.140 --> 53:36.980
Yeah, 30 percent their stock went up in the last

53:37.700 --> 53:46.420
Two days or something like that due to high demand for llm chips. So a large language model chips. Well like machine learning chips

53:48.980 --> 53:52.420
Nvidia don't give a f*** about gamers anymore

53:52.500 --> 53:55.940
It's so annoying because like yeah, they had crypto stuff

53:56.580 --> 54:01.780
And then that sort of died and we were like, yeah come back to us come crawling back, baby

54:01.860 --> 54:04.580
And they're back for like what not even a year

54:05.540 --> 54:10.660
I then they're like, oh new wave to ride. Let's go like oh come on

54:15.540 --> 54:17.540
Oh well

54:17.860 --> 54:26.340
Anyway amd, of course dropped prices on the 7600 xt down to 269 only 36 hours before launch

54:26.340 --> 54:28.740
Okay, I'd actually like to talk about that

54:29.540 --> 54:34.420
We had a whole stick for that video where the intro was going to be amd

54:34.900 --> 54:39.780
I'd be happy to help you learn how to benchmark gpu so that you can price your cards appropriately

54:39.780 --> 54:43.380
And we actually left in part of it and then we kind of went records got

54:45.700 --> 54:48.100
amd changed the price of the card

54:51.460 --> 54:55.060
If all I don't want us to get too good guy amd

54:55.540 --> 54:59.460
About them bringing this card out at a price that is somewhat reasonable

55:00.580 --> 55:05.380
Because it's somewhat reasonable because yeah a it's only somewhat reasonable

55:05.780 --> 55:07.940
It's in line with the rest of their lineup, which

55:08.740 --> 55:12.980
They did you know get aggressive on a little bit, but that's only to

55:13.700 --> 55:18.900
You know deal with the fact that gpu demand is apparently like at a historic low right now or something like that

55:18.980 --> 55:21.620
Like this is not out of the goodness of their hearts

55:22.100 --> 55:27.300
And b they only did it at the last second

55:29.460 --> 55:36.020
Like very last second changing the price of a gpu a day and a half before it's

55:36.580 --> 55:38.340
It's public launch

55:38.340 --> 55:40.340
Is a colossal

55:40.420 --> 55:46.900
Undertaking because they have to basically redo all the contracts that they have with their board partners

55:47.700 --> 55:52.740
Right they have to they have to go and do like a whole bunch of paperwork and I mean

55:52.820 --> 55:56.100
I imagine the account accounting department would absolutely hate this right

55:56.740 --> 55:57.700
um

55:57.700 --> 56:03.620
And I want us to not lose track of the fact that if they were able to price it at 269

56:04.260 --> 56:06.260
36 hours from launch

56:06.260 --> 56:08.260
They could have priced it at 269

56:08.820 --> 56:10.180
36

56:10.180 --> 56:12.180
days from launch

56:12.260 --> 56:18.660
There is nothing about the cost of this card that necessitated the 299 price that they originally

56:19.140 --> 56:21.140
announced to the press

56:21.460 --> 56:22.740
nothing

56:22.740 --> 56:26.740
Clearly and it was only due to some kind of

56:27.300 --> 56:32.180
Probably intense pressure that they would have made a last minute change like this

56:34.900 --> 56:40.020
So I'm I'm annoyed I find it extremely disrespectful

56:40.180 --> 56:42.980
They're like these good guy buy association

56:44.340 --> 56:47.780
Because the other guy's worse. Yeah, well, it's more just like

56:48.580 --> 56:50.580
They could have just done this

56:50.900 --> 56:54.100
They could have they could have been you know pro consumer

56:54.100 --> 56:57.700
They could have cared about consumer value in the first place and they could have

56:58.420 --> 57:00.420
Had it at a good price

57:00.820 --> 57:05.060
But they didn't there's clearly a lot of internal forces at amd

57:05.700 --> 57:10.820
That wanted this card to be priced as high as the market could possibly bear

57:10.820 --> 57:14.820
And it was only at the last second that they ultimately made the decision to back down

57:15.620 --> 57:22.820
And it's extremely disrespectful to everyone else who's involved in the launch of a product like this including media partners

57:23.140 --> 57:26.900
And I know there's going to be the people out there whose takes you know what?

57:26.900 --> 57:30.820
Yeah, maybe I will just start shadow banning because they're phenomenally stupid

57:31.140 --> 57:33.140
But whose takes on this are going to be

57:33.780 --> 57:36.340
Oh, wow complaining about free GPUs

57:38.020 --> 57:42.900
Do you think I need a 7600 XT? Do you think that meaningfully changes my life?

57:43.780 --> 57:46.820
This is this is our our job is to

57:47.620 --> 57:52.580
Make these reviews so that people know what to buy that's that's the whole point

57:52.900 --> 57:58.020
And then the way that that symbiotic relationship works with the manufacturers is if they make a good product

57:58.580 --> 58:03.780
Then as long as we are independent and trusted that will dramatically improve their sales

58:04.420 --> 58:08.420
And the second we're not independent and trusted it will have no impact whatsoever

58:08.420 --> 58:12.260
So it's in their interest to support an independent media, right?

58:15.540 --> 58:19.380
And so when they don't give us the tools to do our jobs properly

58:20.020 --> 58:23.860
Well, it's disrespectful to us and it's also disrespectful to you guys

58:23.940 --> 58:30.980
There was a not insignificant probability that if any outlet, you know, had a family emergency or something like that

58:31.380 --> 58:33.380
they wouldn't be able to

58:33.700 --> 58:39.140
Get the proper message out to their viewers now the good news is that for any written outlet a price change is

58:39.860 --> 58:41.860
theoretically pretty easy to adjust

58:42.420 --> 58:44.420
You just kind of go oh

58:44.900 --> 58:47.620
Okay, uh control h299

58:48.580 --> 58:57.620
269 have replaced but because it's so dramatically changed the value proposition of this card, which is a value

58:58.500 --> 59:03.140
Tier card. I wouldn't say budget, but definitely it's it's about the value

59:03.140 --> 59:06.820
You're not buying a 7600 x t because you're going for the utmost in performance

59:07.140 --> 59:10.740
You want bang for the buck, right? And it it changed

59:11.620 --> 59:13.380
it changed the

59:13.380 --> 59:19.460
Angle of the video a lot and for video that's even harder to adjust because you need to change the script

59:19.460 --> 59:22.100
Then you need to reshoot it. We actually had to fully reshoot that video

59:22.420 --> 59:26.500
The only reason that we reused some of our original shoot was because

59:27.220 --> 59:29.220
I just kind of thought it was funny to

59:30.020 --> 59:34.100
Have my outfit changed sporadically throughout throughout the video

59:37.220 --> 59:40.660
Yeah, yeah, okay. Oh, okay. This is great in our in our notes here

59:40.660 --> 59:45.140
It says communication of the drop was scattered and some reviews did actually go up based on the original price

59:45.540 --> 59:46.420
which is

59:46.420 --> 59:49.700
Not a proper service to to you the viewer

59:50.340 --> 59:54.740
AMD's board partners seem to have stuck with the 270 price with the exception of the

59:55.380 --> 59:58.500
ROG Strix OC edition at three hundred forty dollars

59:59.220 --> 01:00:03.860
Um, and then Best Buy has made the interesting choice to price multiple models of the 7600 at 380

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.660
And that's probably because they haven't actually gotten

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:13.220
Written signed confirmation of any kind of rebates that they might be getting on these cards that they probably

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:20.340
Got allocation of completely site unseen not knowing what the pricing was or they got the original pricing only for it to change later

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:26.580
Intel apparently though took the opportunity to slash the a750 to 199

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:30.900
That's actually a pretty interesting price

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.620
AV1 encoding

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.740
Solid 1080p performance and with being able to stream like

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:43.780
There's a very strong argument at that price for streamers grabbing that just as their their streaming card

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.500
Yeah, 200 bucks

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.580
Man, that's a lot of hardware for 200 bucks

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:49.940
Meanwhile

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:55.300
Meanwhile Nvidia wants a hundred dollars for just eight gigs of the ram on that card

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:02.260
And if it doesn't sell man, I just don't think they're gonna give any Fs

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:10.820
They're so busy the LLM cards. Whatever. They're so busy selling every wafer. They can book at TSMC right now

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:15.060
Yeah, they're gonna like AI startups. I just don't book more time. Yeah, who cares?

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.780
Yeah, whatever just shift production to to teslas or whatever. Yeah

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.740
Or a a whatever they they call it these days. I think the tesla branding is gone, but

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.100
Was it a 4000 is that right?

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.900
Uh, no, I think it's something else because a 6000 or something like that

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:36.980
I I can't I can't remember anymore because it seems like they have intentionally made their product stack just completely

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:41.620
Unintuitive. Yeah, why did they take away the quadro name? It was so good

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:47.460
Yeah, and then they had like two different generations of workstation card that have the same model

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:53.380
The only thing that they did that I didn't like was they would have like weird like best buy exclusive generations and then skip

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.780
Over them for everybody else. That was the only thing basically all the rest of it was fine

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.380
Just leave it alone. Oh now now nvidia's naming is

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:04.100
Yeah, now it's a mess that so is amd's for that matter

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:11.460
I I I have gained a renewed interest in amd's cards because they're just a killer value right now from about

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:16.580
180 dollars up to realistically like 450 500 bucks

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.140
And so as part of that scrapyard

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:26.980
GPU war thing where I was trying to get the the best bang for the buck gpu for around the price of a 4060 ti at retail

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:33.300
I ended up doing a bunch of research into amd cards that I hadn't really paid much attention to

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.940
Their product stack is a mess

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:42.660
They have a 6600 a 6600 x t and then they have a 6650 x t

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.500
But then in the 7000 generation, they're not doing 50s

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:53.060
They're doing x t x for the more better for one and i'm just i'm looking at this going

01:02:53.300 --> 01:03:00.420
What that what the hell is going on sometimes you have an x t sometimes you have a 50 sometimes

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:05.380
The x t is a huge jump sometimes the 50 is a big jump, but they're both x t's

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:08.020
I cannot wait

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:09.780
for the lab

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.780
To just have a database

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:17.140
Where I can just go okay get that game at that resolution and just show me all of them

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:19.780
Please

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:26.100
Lab i'm so ready. I haven't I haven't told them yet, but one of the things that I would like for us to do never mind

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.260
GPU reviews

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:32.660
One of the things that I would like for them to do is have enough test benches

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:38.580
Oh, yeah, that we can run in that we can run in parallel and we can basically like

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.740
Once a year

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.540
Maybe twice a year if we can make it automated enough

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.820
We just throw every card back on

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:50.660
Run it with the latest drivers and just have this database be

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.500
Up-to-date

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.340
So you can just compare

01:03:54.340 --> 01:04:00.980
Functionally anything with a pcie slot. I have I have vaguely mentioned this and I saw hearts shatter

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:06.180
But I'm sure we'll get there eventually I think it'll I just think it'll take a long time

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.380
They just need more test benches

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:12.340
I mean if it if it gets as simple as we can use machine vision to

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.660
To set up the infrastructure behind all that is going to be like pretty intense

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.140
Yeah, but that sounds like videos to me

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.940
Like I said, it's very

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.580
I believe we can get there

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:29.460
Um, but I don't expect it soon. That's all I'm saying. They got a lot. They got a lot of stuff going on

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.620
There's a lot of moving parts in that their lab

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.980
Yeah

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:38.020
Yeah, I'm I'm excited man. It's gonna be it's gonna be awesome

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:43.140
I had someone ask in float plane chat today if we would make content about cards

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:47.300
Like pretty deep into their life cycle talking about their performance on new drivers

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:53.620
I I don't think that that's something that you're going to see very often. I don't think the content

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.860
on ltt

01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.900
But I think that's something where the lab could end up

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:02.660
digging up, you know cool outliers like

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.180
Man, how how would we train it to look for?

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.140
you know weird

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.060
Anomalies like you know

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:17.460
Hey flag it for us if this card has increased in performance by more than 20 percent if we've tested it in the past

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.220
Yeah

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.780
That would help a lot because then if a test is like

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:25.060
Way outside of expected change then we would know

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.620
Yeah, I guess so

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:32.820
And we're gonna have to have like weekly meetings with the lab kind of like, okay. What have you tested? What what's interesting?

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.980
um, I had a meeting with james today about sort of what our

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:44.100
What our channel strategy is going to look like going forward and it's it's like it's kind of like

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:48.180
Content kind of rolls down a hill sort of thing

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:54.900
So ltt started out as simple basic like reading the packaging unboxings essentially

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.380
and then it turned into

01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:00.660
More like testing and reviews and then it turned into bigger

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:05.380
Projects and became very personality driven and now it's sort of reached

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.020
Yeah, I would say it's it's reached kind of an end game as far as that goes

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:13.060
And then we identified that there was this

01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:18.420
Content gap that we were no longer filling and we went. Oh, okay. How about short circuit then?

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:25.060
Short circuit will now do the the simple easy cheapo unbox. Okay. No, we're gonna start adding data to short circuit

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:29.300
Let's make that more like a review. Okay, but then what about these simple unboxings?

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:34.020
Well, you know what we're gonna have data for those two and then we're gonna do these category specific channels

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:36.420
I think you guys might be

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:41.780
Disappointed when you see the production values of these. Oh, yeah

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:46.420
Every single power supply that ever exists. It might just be hands

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:53.700
Unboxing some very basic b-roll. We might have to find a way to essentially cut these with ai

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:58.340
And then have an editor go in and fix there are ai video editing tools

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.780
Like it might be pretty basic

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.980
But if our if our goal is to you know

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:10.660
Have a video that could belong on every single product page on new egg or something like that in the longer term here

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:15.860
Realistically how how much? Um

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.860
How much more is there going to be for us to say about the 13?

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:24.980
500 or the 13 400 core i5

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.860
I

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.900
Man i'm gonna be really interested to see

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:37.300
What we'll be able to do with a labs datasheet a large language model

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:42.500
And a writer to kind of go in and clean it up. It's gonna need that. Um

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:47.700
Where we basically just go okay feed the llm

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:52.660
all the performance data and specs of this product and

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.220
everything within

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:57.220
50 dollars of it on either side

01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.220
and

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.620
Uh, you know the top tier from that generation

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:09.620
Yeah, what would it spit out would it say compared to amd's whatever it's like this and that's still

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:16.900
30% worse than the best intel has to offer but it like if we if we gave it enough samples

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:21.620
Like if we wrote them manually to start and then fed that to it would it be able to

01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:24.580
To generate anything usable. I don't even know

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:29.780
What could be kind of interesting is eventually if we have like site analytic like a user

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.420
How people use the labs website?

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.580
Analytics that are good. We could use that to fuel content direction

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:41.780
Like if we start noticing a ton of people start comparing some certain cards or whatever

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.580
We could be like maybe content time

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.500
That's pretty cool. I do stuff like that. Okay. I'm liking that

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:56.340
Not yet. Not yet. It's gonna take time. Yeah, that's fine. We've got time. We've got money speaking of which lttstore.com

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:01.540
And speaking of which our sponsors the show is brought to you today by vessy

The show is also brought to you by oh, this is a super cool monitor

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:32.900
I am actually considering okay. I'll read the talking points at some point

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:38.500
But I'm pretty close to swapping out my 120 hertz 16 by 9 for this thing at home

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:42.420
I've had it in on my test bench in the garage ever since we did the review

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.660
and

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.660
Every time I'm out there. I'm just like

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.580
Yeah, I should just bring this inside

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.580
And it's it's it's done little things

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:55.780
Like okay, it's some done not done little things being able to adjust the angle is super cool

01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:02.420
Um, it's 240 hertz instead of 120 like the one that I'm using or it's either 120 or 144

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.740
Anyway, it's a little smoother

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:09.220
And a big one is that it would mean that if I want to start streaming again more regularly

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.420
My camera could be in a way better position. Yeah

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:20.740
A big big 16 by 9 monitor is actually not that great for webcam positioning. Yeah. Anyway, sorry talking points blah blah

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:22.660
45 inch

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.660
1000 nit peak brightness

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:30.100
Three-year warranty with burn in protection and you can check it out at the link in the video description

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:34.900
Oh, okay, that's not creepy at all cool

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.300
Oh my goodness

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.940
Hey, Dan. I'm happy. Hey, Dan spots are back. Hey, Dan

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:47.140
We don't know what to do. Tell us what to do. Tell us what to do three messages

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:51.380
Okay, well, then why didn't you just read a merge message? Yeah, Dan. Yeah

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:56.420
It's gonna be less effective trying to yell at it when we're in taiwan. Yeah, that's true

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.460
Oh, yeah, we're gonna next week is gonna be the taiwan show

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.260
Oh

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.740
Why do I think of that? Oh

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.780
Uh, yeah, okay, fine. Uh, we'll do some merge messages if you insist

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:15.780
Uh, okay, uh another dan has a question for the talent

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:21.860
Uh ltx is coming soon and with the whale land. I would like to hear your tips for traveling with land gear

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:26.340
Oh, man. I mean gpu out. Yeah, it takes a gpo never

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:29.940
Never put your tower down below if you can avoid it

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:34.500
It's a strong argument for yeah like in the luggage check

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:39.460
Like if you can if you can small form factor it and bring your computer with you

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.980
I man, I would try flying but at the very least

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:47.140
Take your gpu out of the system pack it up with stuff

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.860
We did a video

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:52.020
I forgot about this

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.100
Um

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.340
Linus how to pack your pc

01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.620
Here hold on a second

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:04.500
How to not smash your pc gaming rig packing and moving guide. This was

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:10.660
This must have been more than three years ago. Hold on just a gosh darn second here. What's the exact date on this?

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:14.020
Yeah, july 1st 2019. This was in the lead up to

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.820
LTx the last time we did it look at this hair

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.060
um

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:23.860
And the whole idea was that we were going to be doing a big land and we wanted people's computers to make it safely

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:27.380
So we show you guys all these ways that you can pack up your computer safely

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.500
Oh, yeah, this stuff is really good. Yeah. Yeah, yeah

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.660
Yeah, so that's that's a whole video that only got a million views

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:39.300
But hey, I think we just got a nice little bump from the 500

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:44.900
People who are coming to whale land. Yay small bump little bump. All right. Hit me dan

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:49.860
Dll with how much you guys work when show lasting four to five hours

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:53.620
How do you manage a good work slash family balance?

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.580
Um

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.540
Well, I'm supposed to be home already

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:08.420
So that I can spend a bit of time with my wife before I go to the airport what times our flight

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:16.420
2 a.m. 2 a.m. So I fly out in six hours takes quite a while to get there. Um, it's been a challenge

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:21.060
Yep, uh, but but I schedule time for family

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:23.940
So every every week I

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:30.180
Um, I go to my daughter's martial arts class with them. So I help participate in the class

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:35.860
Um, also I do badminton training with my kids like I I'll play with them

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:41.220
Um, you know, whether it's like family game night or board games or movie night or whatever else

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:44.260
You know, we make sure that we do those things at least a couple times a week

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:47.060
We weren't swimming on the weekend like you just have to schedule it

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:50.500
I think is is the typical response you'll hear from busy people

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.060
Get it on the schedule. Um

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.620
And the funny thing about it is that like

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.940
My parents were super busy, but I didn't really think about it until I became a parent

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:03.300
Like you you remember like, oh, yeah, we would go to

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:08.260
You know playland or we would do this or we would do that and you think bad and you're going. Yeah

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:13.620
We did that like four times. Um, like kids memories are funny and I I think my kids think I spend a lot of time with them

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.620
Actually, so it's it's good

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:20.660
You know bedtime stories making sure that you kind of catch them at least once a day

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.540
And and do something with them. I think it's really important

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:29.700
My life is a lot easier. Don't have kids. I do I am hoping to

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:35.300
Have some on a time at home though because my birds have been away all week. Have I told you this at all?

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:40.100
Okay, so when I was in houston doing one of the coolest things I've ever done in my darn life, um

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:44.180
We boarded the birds at the vet. It's pretty common

01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:48.180
For people to board their birds at vets when they go away

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:54.740
Is it common for the vet to not bother taking care of their birds at all? Yeah, uh, so there's a continuation of that story

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.300
Oh, they have mites

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.780
Your birds have mites that they got

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.340
Are you sure at the vet?

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.540
Okay, I shouldn't joke

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:10.740
I'm too pissed to find it funny. It was pretty good, but I'm very angry right now. So I didn't it didn't seriously

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:16.340
They have vet mites. Yeah, so we contacted the vet and they were like, oh, yeah

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:23.140
So we had our second infestation of mites ever in our like entire history and they're they've been around for a very long time

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:28.740
Yeah, this is like the worst ever and things are bad. Bring them back and we'll take care of them

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.020
Scoop the blue and white one

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.700
was anemic

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:39.220
And birds are you know humans are like mostly water birds mostly air they have like no mass to them, right?

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.460
So if it's anemic

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:45.620
That's really bad real bad. So it was like good care of your birds last time

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:47.700
So so big concern

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:50.820
And they're they're probably home right now

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.740
Actually, so I'm hoping to see them for some amount of time before we leave

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:57.380
Because I am

01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:02.260
Big screechy man that wants to see little tiny boarb before I go away for two weeks

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:05.460
You're a good bird dad

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:11.540
Yeah, I don't think I could be as attached to a bird as you seem to be to your bird

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:15.780
Else I don't have kids. Yeah. Well, I think it's one of those things where oh boy

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:20.260
This is oh, this is going to be a hot day. We should do the next merge message as a parent

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:27.540
I often hear people, you know, like dog people. Oh, yeah, I know it's not people talk about how much it's like kids

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:29.620
Oh, no, and I'm just like

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:30.980
Nope

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:34.660
It's an animal. Yeah, you feel that way because you don't have kids

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:37.380
Like I thought I loved cats

01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:39.380
a lot

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.380
and like now i'm like

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.580
Oh

01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:44.340
No, it's just a cat

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.340
Okay, I mean I like my cats

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.220
And you can care about maybe love them a little

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:54.420
But it's it's not the same. Emma and I actually have this conversation like often

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:57.700
And I'm like no like they're cool. I care about them a lot

01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:03.700
I will do a lot for them, but you only have that much energy for your dog because

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:10.500
Yeah, no, it's just a dog. I'm sorry. Yeah, and like dogs are cool

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:14.500
Super cool. My birds are fantastic. Yep. Love my cats

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:21.860
But and we went through a lot. Okay. Here's the here's the fun part. You'll know how much I liked doing this

01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:26.580
Uh, they sent us this huge pdf about like, okay, so you had mites

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:33.700
Um, because now we had mites in our house, right? Yeah, and we found them my girlfriend found them because they were crawling on the blanket

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:38.260
So it's not they weren't they're not just on the birds. They're not just in the cage

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.740
They are now in our house

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:44.180
So it's like this is how you deal with things now that you have mites in your house

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:48.020
And they're like you will effectively never get rid of this infestation

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:54.660
Some of the reasons why are they'll get into like your couch and you can't get them out of your couch

01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.780
Guess what my response was

01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:59.620
Let's see how well

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:03.300
Well, I just can usually pin me pretty well, but this one was interesting. So we'll see

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.260
To get rid of mites

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.020
Ah

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.220
arson

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:15.060
Um, because you can't get it out of certain things. So like well, yeah, my computer chair is right next to the cage

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.220
They sit they sit literally right here

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:21.540
The couch is literally right on the other side of that the solution to this

01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.780
There's a carpet that was right beside them as well

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:27.940
I mean, no, you have to have just hauled it out immediately. Yep. Yeah

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:32.020
Yeeted my couch my computer chair and my giant carpet. Thanks vet

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.700
So my how you walk into my house and it echoes now, right?

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:39.620
Like I actually yeeted like half of the furniture that I own

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:43.700
And I'm gonna leave on this trip and come back and have no computer chair

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:47.620
Sick. I have like a dining room chair like I'll be fine. But like

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:53.220
What a pain in the butt. Oh my god. I'm so annoyed. Anyways

01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:59.220
Ah good one. Okay, I get I get a courtesy chuckle for that one

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.220
This is great. I can't believe the vets didn't tell you bro

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:08.340
Bro, I I'm I think I think I'm gonna start implementing my shadow banning

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:13.940
Uh, I got a got a twitch message loving a self-reproduction of yourself is the height of hubris

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:17.860
That is actually not what a kid is

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:23.060
You're a f***ing idiot miniature line has cloned

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.780
Like actually

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:27.780
Like actually your brain is bad

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.740
Oh

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.580
It's like you can't have that bad of a take

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:41.540
Because your your brain couldn't possibly get there from a place of being remotely functional

01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:43.220
Um

01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:47.380
Without it actually being real like that's that's kind of how it works

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.700
Oh my god

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.020
Next message is that how many more?

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:05.860
We will not have enough you got 10 minutes. Yeah, hit me again. Uh eight sleep. Should we talk about that?

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:13.380
Yeah, you gotta talk about it at some point some viewers were upset that eight sleep who sponsored a video last week requires a mandatory

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:17.460
Subscription I do want to put an asterisk on here because I've talked about eight sleep on the show a few times

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.460
I'm about how I have one and how I like it a lot

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:24.820
I I'm 99.9 percent sure it was not a mandatory. No, we could talk about that. It is. Oh, yeah

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:27.220
No, when I bought mine. Yeah back then so

01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:33.860
It requires a mandatory subscription for at least a year to their premium features and it's really expensive

01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:38.260
Just as a note to their premium features with the purchase of their temperature controlled

01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:41.620
mattress topper the product super basic feature

01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:46.180
Heating slash cooling works without the subscription

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:49.620
There's nothing forcing users to continue to buy it after the first year

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:57.700
At our request eight sleep has agreed to double their discount offer from 150 to $300 to cover the cost of the subscription

01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.220
And we've let them know that we won't be working with them moving forward

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:08.420
Unless they make changes to their subscription model and commit to an open source transition should the company go out of business

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:11.060
Hopefully that helps address things with you guys

01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:18.020
I got to be honest with you the reason that I didn't know this was a problem is because I'm using my eight sleep topper

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:25.220
Without a subscription because I looked at the features of the subscription and what I wanted it for and I went

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:29.300
Yeah, not really worth it. And it was optional back then

01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:33.620
And I didn't realize that you had to buy the year of subscription

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:38.020
Honestly, I think they could have just messaged this better if the price was just higher

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:42.500
And it included the first year of subscription free boat like that's

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:47.700
Exactly, then I don't think anybody would have the people would have said it was expensive

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.500
But they wouldn't have called it

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.140
You know evil or predatory or whatever else

01:22:53.540 --> 01:23:00.180
Um, so anyway, it is really expensive without with or without the subscription. Whatever it is very expensive. Yeah, it's very expensive

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:07.300
But hey, thanks eight sleep for dealing with it in terms of how the discount code works

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.300
It's cool that they did that and hopefully

01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:14.660
These guys will make a commitment to ensure that these things don't turn into

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:19.060
You know, just 35 pounds of just e-waste

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:24.260
Um, if the company were to ever go out of business with that said given how much their subscription costs

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:29.380
I think it'd be a real challenge for them to go out of business. Um, but as expensive as it is

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.700
like

01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:36.180
I like the product and a lot of people were posting misinformation too though

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:38.980
They were saying that without the subscription you can't use the app

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:44.180
That is not true. That's correct. Um, I do not just doesn't do autopilot

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:47.700
Which is the auto adjusting feature, right? I don't have a subscription

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:51.860
My phone is almost dead. So you can barely see my battery saver screen or whatever

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:56.900
But this is my this is my dashboard. That's rough my temp dial

01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:01.220
My temp dial I get that almost every day as well. Definitely works

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.740
Oh, oh my sleep. Pay attention. Yeah score of 26

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:06.980
Yeah, well

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:08.980
I mean

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:13.300
What do you want from me? I yeah, I don't sleep well

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:16.740
Uh, but anyway, uh, yeah, my temp dial works and

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:21.780
It will adjust throughout the night, but it doesn't adjust based on my body temperature

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:29.140
So I just have to kind of dial it into what I like and the challenge there is that if you are not in a temperature controlled space

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:31.540
Like my my house has climate control

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:36.180
Right, if you're not in a temperature controlled space, then it could be a lot more important to have the automatic thing

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:39.460
But then presumably you aren't paying for climate control

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.300
So

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:48.180
I see why people were upset and that's why we've gone to them and said, okay, look here's our list of demands

01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.460
But I also do see the value of the product. It's not

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:59.940
Oh, I've actually done pretty good lately. I've got you beat 74. That's that's very good for me. Wow. Good job, luke

01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:03.540
Thank you. Uh for the last uh for the last five days

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.100
I have a sleep score of 26

01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.820
41 80

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:11.220
37 44

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:16.180
And uh, I have a a full 100 from last sunday

01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:19.220
Um, yeah

01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.780
That's pretty good

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:27.380
Man, I slept till like 11 30 though. So that's yeah, that explains that

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.660
Uh, my my kids let me sleep in that day

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:39.140
Well, you want to talk about next. Oh, right. We should also talk about that other sponsor snafu this week on tech quickie

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:45.780
Where we had that sponsor that was like a like a neck cooler thing. Oh, I heard about this. Okay

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:48.660
I tried it

01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:51.060
It's like kind of cool pun intended

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.500
But it's a kickstarter, right or something. Yeah, so that I didn't

01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:58.500
know

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:01.380
Um, so I've reiterated to the team

01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:08.500
Hey, we can't really do kickstarter indiegogo stuff. However, the reason they let it through is not entirely stupid either

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.380
This is a company that basically uses

01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:15.220
crowdfunding campaigns as a marketing vehicle

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:23.620
So, you know how even though we don't talk about products on indiegogo or whatever, but i'm constantly covering ianio

01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:31.140
Well, they their product development just happens anyway. Yes, and they use it's kind of it's almost like marketing at that point

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:35.700
so this company has also got a very similar history of just

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:42.020
Releasing products via crowdfunding campaign as a marketing vehicle. So that's why they made the call

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:46.580
But the issue here, I think was that there were a very rando company

01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:53.220
That our viewers were not familiar with at all and therefore didn't have that trust built up at all

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:56.340
And so we got a fair amount of pushback on that and rightly so

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:58.900
also the talking points were

01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:02.100
Stupid and I talked to the business team about that as well

01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:05.380
Like one of the talking points was that the fan is ai controlled

01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:14.100
And i'm like if your fan is ai controlled you did it wrong because you're powering an ai processor in your in your

01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:22.980
Like neck cooler that should probably be using that power for cooling your neck and just have a simple fan curve on it, right?

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:26.100
So I talked to them about how we can't just

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:29.860
Take silly talking points at face value

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:34.820
We have to make sure that we are communicating things in a way that is representative of the actual product

01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:39.620
What does the product do? It cools your neck. It kind of feels like

01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:42.340
Having like a chili water bottle

01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:44.580
around your neck like this

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:46.100
You know what?

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.100
I like it

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:55.380
Is it going to be the difference between, you know going out in 45 celsius heat and being immediately comfortable?

01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:02.100
I think it's I think it's fair if if it's a company without a proven track record and it's a it's a kickstarter indiegogo level

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:07.220
Preorder, I think that part's fair. But like you said, you didn't know it was that so I don't know

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:10.980
So yeah, I mean I only I only found out about this

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:13.940
After it was already a controversy

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:19.060
But I think you know what things like this are going to happen more and more and I'm just going to have to kind of

01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:22.020
Get used to it as chief vision officer

01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:26.260
I'm probably going to end up running damage control more often as opposed to less often

01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:28.820
If part of the goal here is for me to not be

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:35.140
Like hour by hour involved in absolutely everything that this company does because it's just it's not possible anymore

01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:38.340
Theoretically, hopefully we have less though like for a change

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:43.220
Hold on. What were the two controversies? There was the okay the eight sleep one

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:47.700
I had something to do with but I didn't know all the details and to the business team's credit

01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:51.300
They did tell me that there was some kind of controversy around the subscription

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:56.180
And I waived it away because I kind of went well. Yeah, but like I don't know. I use it without the subscription. Who cares?

01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:04.820
Whoops, right, but then this other one with the weird neck cooler thing. I actually didn't know anything about it until the whole thing was done

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:08.180
And I'm just going to have to

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.700
Like get used to it, I guess. Yeah

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:15.460
So we're going to make some mistakes. We had this conversation

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:18.260
Yvonne and I had this conversation today where she was talking about

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.500
I was I was talking about

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:26.660
This thing that we're implementing and security issues around it and like who should be able to have what level of access to various things

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:27.860
if you're not

01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:29.860
and she was kind of just

01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.580
thinking out loud about how

01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:34.420
it's

01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:40.820
Interesting and in some ways difficult but in some ways good whatever like just kind of thinking out loud about the idea that it's not

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.700
Always just Linus of Vaughn

01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:45.940
Run everything all the time anymore

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:55.940
It's weird we can't yeah, it's not possible. Nope. It's like a bright out like almost 120 people. We added like two more people on Monday

01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:59.460
What yeah

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:03.220
The the Monday morning meeting like always has a picture in it these days

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:06.100
like always

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.820
Well, you're not helping no

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:11.860
Mine were all pre-approved bro. Mine were all pre-approved like last year

01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:16.340
I don't deny it

01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:18.980
Should we talk about the invisible pc setup?

01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.580
Uh, yes, yes

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.500
Invisible mouse

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.340
invisible keyboard

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.340
hologram monitor

01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:37.620
This channel is actually amazing. This is the only thing I've seen but it was awesome and I

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:42.180
Oh, no, he did this like super tiny one too and specifically called me out to beat it

01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:46.100
And I was like, I can't what am I gonna do you've taken this to

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.740
completely

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:56.820
Um, yeah, this was sick. I actually didn't even know that's kind of funny

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:02.900
I didn't know this was gonna be in the dock. I watched like a short I think on it

01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:07.860
And then was like, man, I wish I could see the whole thing. So now I need to watch the whole video

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:16.100
Okay, I see so yeah, the the keyboard is like embedded in the table, but there isn't a mouse

01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:19.460
Which is interesting because there's products like that

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:24.180
He could have used the same technology for the keyboard, but I actually am happy that he didn't

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:27.220
Because there are limitations to it

01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:30.340
Right

01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:33.140
Adjustable sense. Oh my goodness

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:36.580
This is amazing. That looks so insane

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.900
Absolutely next that looks like something from like a

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:47.380
A movie on like future tech and ai from like the early 2000s. Yeah, you know where they fake it

01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:52.900
But he actually did it. Yeah, you guys are gonna have to watch crazy. You should absolutely check it out

01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:55.300
That's super cool

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:59.860
All the stuff that's embedded in here the zero gram invisible mouse. I love the gaming memes

01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.660
fantastic

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:03.780
Wow

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:09.780
Okay, I'm going to have to super cool. Can we can we can people post the link to that in chat or something?

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:15.380
Of course. Oh, I mean, I can just do it. Cool. Yeah. Yeah people are asking for the link. Yeah. Yeah, don't worry. I don't worry

01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:17.140
I got you guys. I got you guys

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:20.260
Basically homeless go check out the the super tiny one as well

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.820
I gotta watch more of his stuff

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:28.340
Because that was really one of those channels like diy perks where like he doesn't publish that much

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:36.100
Um, so it's easy. I freaking love diy products like like that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we're just like they're not

01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:42.820
They're not prolific publishers like we are but every time they drop. It's a banger. It's a banger

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.820
YouTube chat. I bet it's a poor experience

01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:50.580
That is not the point

01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:55.140
This is why I never look at youtube chat

01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:57.620
Oh

01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:04.100
Actual unwashed masses jk. I love you youtube chat. Yeah, at least you're not as bad as twitch chat. There you go. Boom

01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:06.820
Got him. Okay

01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:12.100
Uh rip cortana. Do we only have one way an afterdark? We have five minutes

01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:17.220
Okay, the national eating disorders association replaced their helpline

01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:20.340
with a chat bot

01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:25.140
They've replaced all hotline workers and volunteers with a chat bot

01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:28.580
Four days after the workers voted to unionize

01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:32.820
If you thought ai is not coming for my job

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:36.660
And you worked for the national eating disorders association

01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:39.620
You no longer think that you were objectively

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.500
Incorrect. This is absolutely

01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:45.380
mind-blowing and this is

01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.700
The the the leading edge

01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:51.860
But this is the tip of the wave that's coming

01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:56.980
The hotline workers included a handful of paid staff as well as around 200 volunteers

01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:00.420
The employees demands did not include pay raises

01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:06.660
They asked for higher staffing levels and ongoing training to deal with staff burnout and ballooning wait times

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:13.300
Um netta has used the chat bot called tessa since february of 2022

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:20.740
It is not based on chat gpt and does not make decisions or grow it follows predetermined pathways

01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:25.220
Based on the knowledge of the researchers who made it. So this is an old school chat

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:29.060
I I went into this assuming it was an ai chat bot. This is an old school chat bot

01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:34.420
Like the thing that helped you with that better or worse your lego thing probably better because like okay

01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:36.100
At least it won't hallucinate. Yes

01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:41.540
The reason why I freaked out about this was remember when we had that conversation forever ago about the ai that

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:46.740
It convinced the dude to kill himself. Yeah, join them or whatever. I always worried that type of stuff would happen

01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:51.460
Um, but it like won't happen with this type of system

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:55.060
Yeah, but while many users have rated the bot as helpful

01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:01.540
Its creator has stated that it is not an adequate replacement for a human staffed help. Yeah, so that all sounds right

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:11.220
Man helpline volunteers were asked to act as testers for the chat bot instead of providing one on one

01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.620
report to callers

01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:16.580
70 000 people last year wow

01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:23.060
So wait, what what actually happened because it said they did this they've been doing this since february 2022

01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:27.460
So did they do this back in february 2022 or what what changed?

01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:36.340
No, no, they've just had it now. It's just all that's available. So they just dropped everybody. Yeah. See you later. Wow

01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:43.540
Um, this this is kind of wild the google play store has suspended the app downloader a

01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:53.220
Popular app for side loading on android tv following a dmca takedown from several israeli tv companies who complained that the app is

01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:56.420
capable of loading piracy websites

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:01.940
Yeah, that face is uh about how you should be feeling about this right now

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:06.980
Downloader is essentially a combination of a web browser and file manager

01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:11.300
That allows android tv owners to easily download files from the internet onto their device

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.260
It can display piracy websites. Yes

01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:20.900
But only to the same degree that any other web browser can display piracy websites

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:23.220
So they need to remove chrome from the play store

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:25.460
Yeah

01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:29.700
The specific piracy site that was noted in the complaint sidaro sidara

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:33.380
I don't know has received injunctions from israeli and u.s federal courts

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:38.660
However, it is still online and can still be accessed in google chrome

01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:45.940
Prior to the takedown downloader had been downloaded over five million times. Yo dawg. I heard you like downloading

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:52.580
So I put a downloader in your downloads. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Um google has rejected the developer's appeal to reverse the decision

01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:58.420
It's still available on the amazon app store and the developer's own website where you can side load it, I guess

01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:00.900
But if it's for side loading can

01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:03.060
Can we just

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:08.900
Can we just stop letting tech illiterate people make legal decisions about tech? Is that something we can do?

01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:11.300
Do we have that power?

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:18.180
Then again, you let big tech be in charge of it and they're just going to walk all over everybody anyway

01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:20.180
It's not going to be better. Yep. Oh

01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:22.820
Yep

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:25.540
Oh man, that's really stupid

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:32.820
Like how many points did your IQ drop just hearing this the what was remaining I'll say

01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:35.140
Um

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:38.660
Let's move on. We don't have that much time. Yeah, fine. Do we have any time for more?

01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:44.740
Was arrested for posting monetizing and posting and monetizing copyrighted content

01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:52.020
The 52 year old youtuber was accused of uploading and monetizing a playthrough of the visual novel stein's gate

01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:57.620
My darlings embrace a romantic comedy dating sim without permission from the developer

01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:03.460
They had likewise posted videos that contained footage from anime series. Uh, these were not full episodes

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:08.260
They were narrated summaries condensing the material which is a popular video genre in japan

01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:15.460
A primary point of contention was the relatively long duration of the videos and the fact that they contained the game's ending

01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:19.860
Meaning that they might act as a replacement for the original material seriously arrested

01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:24.420
Bad precedent. Yeah

01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:28.820
And this kind of seems to explain why nintendo doesn't

01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:32.820
Understand how the entire rest of the world

01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:38.340
Views fair use because my understanding is fair use like kind of doesn't really exist there. Is that

01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:43.060
Yeah, at least not in the same way that it does here. I have no idea, but I don't think so

01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:47.060
I have also heard some pretty intense arguments against people

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:53.300
Streaming or making let's plays or whatever of visual novels specifically. Is that what this was? Yeah, I was reading some

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.220
Yeah, because oh no romantic comedy dating sim, but yeah

01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:02.340
Seems to be very story driven

01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:03.540
Yeah, okay

01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:09.380
So i'm gonna go on a tangent I guess and just say for visual novels specifically because this is a thing on like steam and stuff

01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:13.780
People have been pretty against it because you're basically live streaming

01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:16.420
flipping the pages in a book

01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:18.580
And you're showing all the pages in the book

01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:25.380
Right like they're they're actually is not any other content. You're not playing the game, right?

01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:29.300
So I don't know this one sounds like it's not that but that's just like I know that's a

01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:33.780
An argument that's going on. Yeah, jake from the lab who I think lived over there for a few years

01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:37.220
Says this is an interesting one as japanese copyright law

01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:43.620
Dictates that the owners need to aggressively defend their copyright kind of like how trademark laws work here

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.020
So this may not actually be

01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:50.820
Something that the developer the developer necessarily wants to do but if they want to keep their copyright

01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:53.300
That's it

01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:58.420
Oh, seriously activision shuts down community run servers for legacy cod

01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:00.900
See you later

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:05.060
Sees and desist from activision. So the problem is that those community servers

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:10.260
Were the only safe way to play those games because activision is not keeping their own servers up to date

01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:12.500
so you can

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:14.500
something something

01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:17.060
Attack people through activision servers because they're not secure

01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:21.780
I don't know all the details, but I know it's like bad and they implemented their own anti-cheat

01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:25.540
Which is super cool. This is for the original modern warfare 2. Yeah, it's like way better

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:33.380
Ah a possible cause for their legal action is the fact that one of xlab's setup guides contained a link to an illegal copy of the game

01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:36.740
Well, that's bad, but then they should have just said take that down

01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:41.700
Yeah, but then I can see why they don't want to micromanage this. Yep. Yeah, I shouldn't have done that

01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:48.020
So the modern warfare 2 steam page has seen a wave of negative reviews claiming that the game can no longer be safely played

01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:49.220
That's true

01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:54.740
Discussion questions. Is there a way for companies to defend their ip while allowing the community to take over old games?

01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:57.540
If they're no longer interested in maintaining them. Yes, there is

01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:03.460
Sort of because with supreme commander, which is super cool the way that fa forever exists

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:08.020
That was an ip that was no longer actively being developed. Whereas call of duty

01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.740
is

01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:13.940
So it's all fine and good as long as this

01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:20.100
You know xlabs version of the server is good and nobody is getting infected or whatever

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:27.300
But as soon as they make a mistake. Well, whose liability is that? Yeah, but then you shouldn't it should be

01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:32.500
Yeah, it's a messy topic. It's harry, but they should not

01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:41.220
There should be some form of recourse for them selling old games at full fat price

01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:48.420
That are unplayable safely. Well, yeah for massively extended periods of time

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:52.500
I think you get like three bucks in your class action. Uh pale. Yeah

01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.580
Yep, just never matters

01:41:57.780 --> 01:41:59.780
And youtube killed stories

01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:03.540
I am never getting a stories function on my foldable device

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:09.380
Because youtube turned off the feature or is turning it off june 26th

01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:15.540
That is the last date and apparently it's because almost no one uses them. I mean they got a lot of views

01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:17.860
Um back when you know, they were a thing

01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:23.780
But they want people to use community posts which appear to be gaining traction and upload shorts

01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:25.460
So there you have it

01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:31.220
I'm never getting stories and I guess that's okay because it didn't really matter except that there were some really cool things

01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:34.740
You could do with stories like we're applying to comments with a story

01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:39.140
Sometimes it's not convenient to type out a thing on my phone and I'd like to just I had pitched to them

01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:44.820
Hey, how about expanding stories so that it's a feature that exists more like in the comments under a video

01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:48.740
So, uh, you know a comment that got a lot of upvotes

01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:53.060
I'd be able to just click a button in my creator app and record a quick response to it

01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:56.740
And it could just live there like there are absolutely cool ways that uke's thing

01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:00.020
I want to talk about is our 45,000 watt fan

01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:08.420
Okay, think about that number. Yeah, do I know 45,000 watts? Yeah, I've seen it

01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:11.140
Did you see it in operation? No

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:13.460
How long was it in operation?

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:15.620
scary

01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:18.260
Probably a total of about

01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:19.940
10 15 minutes

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:20.820
Oh, wow

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:23.780
Because that's as long as we can power it for yeah

01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:32.740
It is it actually draws so much power that we could not safely power it with the entire output of the transformer

01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:35.220
In that unit

01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:37.220
That's so insane

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:39.220
I'm just like

01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:45.620
What that it generates so much thrust that it could almost hover with me sitting on it

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:54.740
Wow, it's going to be it's going to be a fun video. Do you know what they're used for?

01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:58.340
I don't know. Oh, we probably should have talked about that

01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:01.460
Uh, whoops

01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:03.780
Whoops

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:08.420
Well, maybe okay, they have a bigger one. So maybe we'll talk about what they're for in the sequel

01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:11.540
Okay, but we cool a computer with it

01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:13.620
obviously

01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:14.660
Yeah

01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:20.180
I am genuinely interested to see what happens to the components or what you guys did to make it so that things wouldn't happen to them

01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:26.660
Yeah, Alex either one of them Alex and kyle were involved. So, you know, I'm sure it's awesome completely stupid. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited

01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:29.220
Okay, all right time for wancho after dark

01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:31.380
phew

01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:33.380
Which is not that dark anymore

01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:36.660
Because we had some feedback when we listen sometimes went after

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:39.780
slightly darker

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:45.620
Yeah, it's like barely even noticed. Yeah. Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, that's okay. Good job dan. You can tell

01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:49.140
Now that was really dark when he walked right in front of the camera

01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:53.940
Yeah, remember when dan used to remember when dan used to crawl under the camera and stuff and give it

01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:58.180
I used to have production standards and they just

01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:05.780
We broke him throw him away. I don't want to comb my hair anymore. Okay. Uh, murk merch messages, I guess. All right, cool

01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:08.260
Uh, sure

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:14.260
Greetings from quebec since the warranty of my zed fold 3 is now over. I'm afraid to break it

01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:17.860
What would you suggest as a user to keep it as long as possible?

01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:21.460
p.s. When abc of gaming in french

01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.300
Uh

01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:30.180
Okay, so what would you suggest to keep as long as possible? I mean

01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:36.420
Be careful with it. Um as for abc's of gaming in french

01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:38.900
my french

01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:40.900
Not good enough. Um

01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:48.260
I mean, maybe we could try and hire a translate meant that would be a that would be a very difficult thing

01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:54.020
To translate and maintain the meter. Yeah, because it like it rhymes and stuff. Yeah

01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:56.500
Yeah, that's actually pretty rough. I'm like

01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:03.860
There are songs that have been successfully translated from english to french and vice versa

01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:08.580
I think that book would be really challenging having written the english one

01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:16.500
It's almost a whole other book. Well, it also just contains like technical terminology for which the literal direct translation is just that word

01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.540
But like en français

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:22.660
Like with a french accent. So I sorry

01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:27.940
What a a j one of our legitimately actually like francophone

01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:31.460
team members the

01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:36.260
Legitimately, do we have anyone else that I go? Oh, oh, no, there's uh, there's uh, there's other

01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:39.460
A prime other elix

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:44.580
I think that's it. Yeah, I think it's a prime and demo. Yeah, okay. All right, never mind. Um

01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:46.980
Anyway

01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:48.740
No

01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:50.020
Sorry

01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:52.020
Antoine

01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:55.140
Oh, yeah, yeah, he must speak french. So four I think

01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:05.140
I don't know. Oh, uh, David speaks french. Uh, monsieur Gaultier. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so you'd think I would but no la frenière

01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:09.460
Not even a little he doesn't even know what I just said

01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:15.140
No, I do I do I speak french and then my last name

01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:18.900
Okay, I know that much

01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:21.220
That's actually like brushing on the limit

01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:24.740
I

01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:27.300
Know soda moose

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.300
Okay

01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:31.140
Because it's on packages

01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.660
Okay, that's why

01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:35.620
There's no other reason wait like cream soda cream soda

01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:40.340
I thought it was funny when I was a kid. How often do you even fucking drink cream soda?

01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:43.860
I do not remember the last time but when I was a kid. I thought it was funny. So I remembered it

01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:47.220
Okay, yeah, that's what you retain. Yeah

01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:50.020
Okay

01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:54.260
We need to we need to burn through some of these we have like no time

01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:56.500
Yeah, luke

01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:58.500
Cream soda, uh, hello

01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:01.060
Hello linus and luke greetings from germany

01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:08.020
I always wondered if you guys got in trouble or if sponsors frowned upon you guys using memes in your sponsored videos

01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:10.260
It means like 69 or

01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:16.180
420 every once in a while. We had uh, we had a video that was sponsored by

01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:24.900
Someone I don't remember was it was it hp. I don't know anyway the the the the product was there z workstation 420

01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:29.300
And we managed to slip a lot of pot jokes into it

01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:34.580
But there was one particular shot where we actually put like a

01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:38.740
A thing in the front grill of it and had it smoking

01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:44.580
Like they had the computer smoking weed and that did not make it past the sensors

01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:47.300
Oh, yeah, I remember that surprised in

01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:52.900
Geez in general though. I think sponsors know what this is

01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:58.660
Like if you don't do your due diligence watching a couple videos from a channel before you throw money at them

01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:00.740
That's on you

01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:02.740
I don't feel bad

01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:08.900
Uh, any new house videos coming soon. I think it's the most engaging content on the channel

01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:13.940
I don't know. Maybe if my pool ever gets finished speaking of which there's been a new development there

01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:21.300
We've issued an ultimatum. Oh, they they they've been they they told us it was going to be two weeks to completion three weeks ago

01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:23.860
We've had to reschedule our electrician four times

01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:27.620
Because they keep just not showing up

01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:31.220
Um, and so we basically said look, this is ridiculous

01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:37.220
You'll be here on monday and you will be working continuously until the project is done or we're going public

01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:40.820
Um, it's something I hate doing. I actually hate doing it

01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:48.180
But this has actually been insane to the point of like should be criminal. I know it is. Oh, okay in my opinion

01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:51.940
I don't need any libel or whatever. Yeah

01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:54.580
um, but but they have they have

01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:57.540
In my opinion from my experience

01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:03.700
almost certainly broken multiple laws in the way that they've engaged with us and they deserve

01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:07.460
I think

01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:12.180
To never be in business again. Yeah at this point from what I've heard. I completely agree. Yeah, so

01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:20.180
So if uh, if nothing happens on monday, I will uh, I'll see you guys on I'll see you guys next friday

01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:22.260
And I'll let you know how it's going

01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:26.500
There's another contractor that might be willing to pick up the job but

01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:34.260
From from looking at another review of these guys even apparently it like took six months and was like pulling teeth to get a small job done

01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:36.340
so

01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:38.580
I don't know. I guess we'll see how it goes

01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:41.620
Yeah, yeah

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:48.500
Hey dll picking up some merch for linus voice my wife. That's not linus voice. That's borat voice

01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:51.940
But anyway, yes, you're gonna you're gonna do it. No, okay

01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:59.700
With the growing size of ltt and improving markbench. What steps you're taking to ensure gpu reviews are free of errors?

01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:05.300
so a couple things we've added so okay, so one is um as we improve our

01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:07.540
machine vision capabilities

01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:14.820
We are expecting to be able to monitor not just for anomalies in our results, but also anomalies in the

01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:17.540
visuals of the game

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:22.420
That's something that one of our team members actually has some experience with from

01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:25.540
testing mobile games at his previous job

01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:29.300
And in the long term we would like to be able to

01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:39.300
Evaluate the visual fidelity of features like dlss or fsr as part of the way that we present performance data for these gpu's

01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:43.380
That's going to take a long time for now at the very least

01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:47.380
We've implemented a a checking stage where the labs goes through the

01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:52.260
Data and goes through the finished videos to make sure that the writing team didn't miss anything

01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:57.780
Not because the writing team is dumb or incompetent, but because it's often just crunch for these videos and things can get missed

01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:02.580
It's improved things a lot, but there's still room for us to continue to improve

01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:10.020
Hey lld do you guys think any labs content will be at ltx personally?

01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:15.140
I'd love to see some of the stuff y'all are working on demoed for example keyboard testing

01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:20.740
That's a really good question and right now the answer is no. I don't think we have anything planned for ltx

01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:25.860
I mean most of the labs equipment is pretty planted. Yeah, kind of bolted to the ground

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:32.020
Um, oh, yeah, I don't really know what to tell you it could be interesting. I know like uh

01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:36.420
Packs had some multi-site stuff some years

01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:39.060
Could be interesting one year to have like

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:44.500
Oh, this would be really hard. I don't think we could do it actually well. We're offering tours of the lab

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:46.980
as part of ltx

01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:48.580
Yeah, so there's that

01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:51.700
Think of like if we had if you had like another event

01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:55.220
Which was like you could you could go through some testing at the lab

01:52:56.660 --> 01:53:01.620
We're not close to there and that would be very hard. No, we're not be feasible. Yeah, I have no guarantees on that one

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.780
It'd be neat, but it's probably never gonna happen

01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:11.940
Hey lld I often watch videos over discord screen share with friends some sites block screen sharing in this way

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:19.860
What is your opinion of this practice both as a consumer and as float plane executives? I totally get why people do it

01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:25.620
Um, absolutely and also there is absolutely ways around it

01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:28.820
How would you even block that

01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:32.980
I mean, there's ways to oh, right block screen capture

01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:39.620
Yeah, okay. Well anyway, um, I mean I can tell you something shows up on your screen. There is a way to capture it

01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:42.260
Yeah, I mean

01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:46.980
This is a tough one, right because as a consumer, I think it's super cool

01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:53.620
It's one of the features that I actually pitched as something that would be really neat for float plane to have like native support for

01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:55.700
Like native support for

01:53:57.220 --> 01:54:04.660
But I can tell you now that the creator of whatever that is is not being compensated in any way for whatever that is

01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:06.420
so

01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:11.620
Take that for what it is, right? Um, if you if you if you're enjoying this content then

01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:14.980
The idea there is that you

01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:21.940
Should maybe think that the person who created it should be compensated in some way

01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:25.780
Or not and that's that's kind of your call, right?

01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:32.740
But that's what's happening and that's why they block it. Um, I don't think we're putting any effort into blocking it at this point in time, but

01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:37.700
We're also not a small creative team and we're not sort of

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:43.940
Live or die depending on whether we get that $100 check this month or whatever else it is, right? So

01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:48.980
We're quite diversified. Um, yeah, it's tough. You just you just got to

01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:53.860
Think about what you're doing and understand the impact and make your call, right?

01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:56.340
Yep

01:54:56.340 --> 01:55:00.580
Linus, what's with all the fancier sillier wordlier videos lately?

01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:05.060
Um, I don't know. It's just fun. It's just pure fun. I I like it

01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:09.220
I like silly words. I like I like grabbing your attention. Look it worked

01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:18.020
Yeah, I'm going to be in taiwan for the next two weeks. I wonder why uh, do you recommend somebody in the tech industry go to?

01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:23.220
Computex for fun with their significant other or is it too formal? It's industry only

01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:30.260
Um ces I or wait. No, is it ces is I can I can never remember for I'm pretty sure both of them

01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:32.660
There is a way that you can buy a pass, but it's like

01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:35.380
really really brutal well the

01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:39.220
They say that I think they're in the tech industry already

01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:45.940
So if you kind of like oh, they would just go you're in the tech industry. They don't have to go to taiwan right now

01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:48.900
But you're not going to computex

01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:54.900
But they would go to computex for oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, this is very strange. Oh, yeah. No, what yeah, of course. Yeah

01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:57.540
Yeah, computex is fun. It's cool. It is. Yeah, go for it

01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:00.180
See you there

01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:03.940
Hello dan and dan's assistance to the wan show

01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:08.340
I'm using the ltt screwdriver to perform jet engine maintenance currently

01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:12.900
Where is the most interesting place you have found your merch being used?

01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:19.220
I mean there was that time that skating olympian had our water bottle just like casually on tv on the olympics

01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:21.460
Yeah, yeah, that was really cool

01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:24.180
Trying to think there's got it. There's got to be some other cool stuff

01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:28.500
Did any of the did any of the boys at nasa have any of our merch?

01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:33.540
Uh, yeah, okay. That's cool. I didn't actually see it on site

01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:37.540
But we weren't like where they were doing that type of stuff anyways. Yeah, that might make sense

01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:39.540
um

01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:44.020
That we've seen a lot of people review the screwdriver that do really cool stuff

01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:46.820
We saw the guy that works on drift cars in japan. Oh, yeah

01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:52.980
Uh, we we've seen a bunch of different people that do a bunch of random stuff that they need a screwdriver for it's been very cool

01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:55.620
Yeah, it's a good screwdriver. What can I say? Yeah

01:56:56.500 --> 01:57:01.620
There's a bunch in potential liners that are pretty specifically directed at you. Oh, yeah

01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:05.220
It's directed at you that i've been able to answer for you, but not all them

01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:11.860
Okay, toran asks would you ever do an ltt labs official quality certification for specific products like usb and hdmi?

01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:17.860
Um, it depends we'd have to find a way to do it where it doesn't compromise the labs's vision

01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:22.180
Which is to be a check and a balance on these

01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:26.900
certification bodies and these product manufacturing bodies

01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:31.700
Um, I think that you know something like the way that 80 plus operates

01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:34.740
um theoretically is really good, but

01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:37.380
in practice has

01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:40.180
Um

01:57:40.180 --> 01:57:42.180
I think been less

01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:44.180
less effective over

01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:51.460
More recent years and I think that's where cybernetics has had an opportunity to step in and provide a more meaningful certification program

01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:56.740
So if we were going to do something I would just want to make sure that we're only doing it in an area

01:57:57.540 --> 01:57:59.540
Where we have the the time and attention

01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:05.300
To focus on making sure that we are the be all and end all of standards for that particular vertical

01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:07.620
And that's a that's a really challenging thing to do

01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:10.980
It's gonna it's gonna take a long time

01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:13.780
So I can archive that now

01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:16.820
Hey linus loved the show and all the best with your new role

01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:20.180
I was wondering if there were any upcoming videos for channel super fun

01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:23.620
Seems like it's on the back burner at the moment. The answer is

01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:25.860
You are right

01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:29.300
It is on the back burner at the moment. Dennis has transitioned into a new role

01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:38.820
So there is not a formal channel manager for channel super fun right now. Unfortunately. It's just not been sustainable for us from a financial standpoint

01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:41.380
That's business speak for

01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:43.620
We were losing money on it

01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:45.700
again

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:51.460
I don't know what it is. I I I always really enjoyed doing channel super fun when it was just

01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:54.900
kind of hanging out and doing a weird challenge or whatever, but there's

01:58:56.580 --> 01:59:00.580
There's a lot of things that come with being a bigger company that are not a lot of fun

01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:03.140
um channel super fun

01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:05.380
relied on

01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:07.700
just kind of spontaneity and

01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:11.060
uh people participating just for the sheer

01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:17.860
Fun of it and not worrying too much about things like okay prizes or something that are really tough

01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:23.940
Like the meta has changed people expect there to be like a giant prize for give you a car doing something

01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:30.900
But we've done things kind of like that in the past even with small prizes. So when we did the um mario car

01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:33.140
AR racing thing

01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:38.020
Okay on ltt. We offered people winning a day off or something like that

01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:43.140
I think I forget I forget exactly what it was and the amount of backlash internally over

01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:47.620
Not being selected to participate. So not getting a chance to win that

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:54.340
led us to create this whole convoluted program for channel super fun where the participants

01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:57.860
Were actually competing for a prize

01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:04.100
But then everyone else internally could bet on the outcome and share the prize with the participant who won

02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:09.300
So that way everyone could participate and that it's just it like it basically

02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:12.900
This is why we can't have nice things

02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:16.100
because it created a whole bunch of politics and

02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:18.980
You know jockeying for

02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:21.700
being featured on the channel and complaining about

02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:26.660
Not getting screen time or being in a role where you're not on screen or whatever else and I just like

02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:29.300
I can't I just can't anymore

02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:32.900
That's why a lot of you know, I'm not going to name any specifics

02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:38.020
But that's why a lot of those types of channels the the prizes particularly when they're internal for the staff

02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:40.020
It's just all fake like

02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:42.100
Come on guys get real right

02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:44.980
What do you want from me?

02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:53.060
Let's keep turning through. Yeah Linus. Are you officially switching from the steam deck to the rog ally planning a two terabyte

02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:58.100
ssd upgrade in the ally with sabrent's new 2230 two terabyte ssd

02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:00.660
I think he's got one there

02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:02.660
indoor hoody restock when

02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:09.940
Soon soon, I think we've actually got it nailed down and we're we're ready to go to mass production

02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:12.020
But it's going to take a little bit more time

02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:16.980
But yeah, I'm switching over to the ally. I was actually on the ianio next before the ally

02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:22.180
And one of the things I liked about it was that it had support for m.2 2280 drives full length drives

02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:27.060
Although I think you could cram one in the ally if you just had a little m.2 extension thing

02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:28.980
And I'd like to put a bigger drive in it if I could

02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:32.580
Finally caught one of these early

02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:38.660
Linus is a fellow fan of crosscode. What was your opinion on the post game downloadable content?

02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:43.220
And have you seen the in-depth videos of radical fish games new project?

02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:46.260
I didn't actually play the post game dlc. I

02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:52.340
I just I felt like the story ended in such a good place and I was playing for the story not for the dungeons

02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:54.740
I actually found the dungeons a little tedious towards the end

02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:59.380
Especially that twin dungeon where you do one side and then you come out

02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:05.060
There's no story in character development whatsoever and then you do the other side. It's like oh, what a grind

02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:06.420
um

02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:10.580
Like the puzzles were really creative. It's a really really well done game, but

02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:14.340
I I just didn't find anything that appealing about the dlc

02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:20.980
As for their new game. I haven't seen anything, but I will absolutely play it. I consider myself a radical fish fan

02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:27.380
Hey dill love the show my fiance and I have been playing it takes two and having a blast

02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:31.620
What is the first game you and avan ever played together any other recommendations?

02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:34.580
Uh, I want to say pocket tanks

02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:39.460
Oh, that's adorable. Look at this. I I just go on youtube and look at us

02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:42.100
Saying goodbye

02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:47.780
Not not in the way that you think though, but yeah pocket tanks is super fun. Just ultra casual game

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:50.580
Lots of lots of different weapons and stuff

02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:53.860
I think it's like five bucks or something like that

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:59.460
Assuming you can even find anywhere to buy it anymore. You can like put up walls and there's all these like

02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:03.860
cool little like different weapons and stuff that you can use and

02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:09.220
We we've got to the point where it got like pretty intense and we got pretty good at it and stuff

02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:13.860
Like here what this must have been some kind of like area of effect weapon or something

02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:16.980
Uh

02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:20.180
This is pretty slow paced gameplay here guys

02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:24.260
Anyway, that doesn't really matter the point is yeah pocket tanks. That's the first game we played together

02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:32.100
I think would you have taken the leap to start a linus media group if other outlets like ltt gamers next where nexus

02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:36.260
Uh hardware unboxed and mkb hd had existed at the time

02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:39.380
I started ltt because my boss told me to

02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:42.420
so

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:49.860
I guess so the leap to lmg not just ltt. Yeah, I mean yeah because other stuff did exist at the time

02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:53.780
There were other channels. They just didn't happen to be those ones. Yeah

02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:59.940
Linus seems like you have had bad luck with contractors for your house. Oh god. Thanks

02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:05.380
Painters bull people. How can you find good contractors or trade workers?

02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:10.260
It's like interviewing anyone you're gonna get it right sometimes and you're gonna get it wrong sometimes and

02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:19.060
While theoretically, you know, you have the law on your side or whatever and you can hold people accountable in practice

02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:24.580
This is like this is it's the whole trust me bro thing all over again. Yeah, that's right. I'm going there

02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:26.740
um

02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:28.740
luke deep breaths

02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:33.220
At the end of the day at the end of the day a warranty

02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:36.020
or a law or anything

02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:40.980
Only exists to the extent to which it's enforceable one party

02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:44.100
has the has the willingness to

02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:51.060
Honor the agreement and the other party has the willingness and time and capability

02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:54.660
To force the other to honor the agreement. It can be

02:04:55.780 --> 02:05:01.460
life-ruining level expensive to actually try to get a company to follow through with

02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:05.540
What they're legally supposed to do and I know you're about to say small clean

02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:08.820
Sure, you do it. Are you going to?

02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:14.820
Full will and then when you're done and they have that court order to pay you

02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:16.980
Okay

02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:20.500
Then what are you going to pursue them to actually write you the check?

02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:28.100
What if they're fraudsters and they've been Ponzi scheming the whole thing and their check's just gonna bounce anyway

02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:30.580
How how are you gonna follow that up?

02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:33.700
It just

02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:37.300
Yeah

02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:45.460
It is what it is. I were you know where we we hope that we're going to get this resolved in a in an amicable way, but

02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:48.420
I don't I don't know

02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:54.580
Hi, lld. I have a hybrid smartwatch with an eink display behind a set of dials

02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:59.700
Which has most smartwatch functionality and one month of battery life

02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:03.540
Linus, would you use such a watch as a pebble successor?

02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:06.020
um

02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:09.460
What was great about the pebble was just the simplicity of it. It just

02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:12.020
Showed me the text

02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:15.140
When a message arrived and it had hardware buttons

02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:20.820
Uh, that's that's something that I still miss. I actually still use a pebble time

02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:27.540
For uh media control on my motorbike. I just have a pebble time just like magneted to my handlebars

02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:31.300
Because when I got gloves on it still like the only thing I can control

02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:34.020
I think there are accessories that function in much the same way

02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:35.300
But like

02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:38.980
But I have a pebble time who cares and the app is already on my my old phone

02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:43.380
Which is what I use to listen to music when I'm riding my bike. So it works perfectly for me

02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:48.340
And it looks like the last one I have today when you start someone as a new host

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:51.780
How do you evaluate whether they're a good fit to stay in the role?

02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:55.780
Do you give them specific training or is it just sink or swim?

02:06:56.580 --> 02:07:01.460
Huh a little bit of column a a little bit of column b. I mean the audience is going to give them all the feedback

02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:03.540
They could ever hope for so

02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:08.900
Hey, thanks guys some of it valid some of it phenomenally stupid

02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:17.700
Uh ltt screwdriver been using a bunch lately any updates on metrics hex metric hex bits and the stubby version

02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:20.580
Uh, yeah metric hex, uh, doesn't seem to be here yet

02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:24.100
That I'm as up to date on that as you are you can message support though

02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:28.340
And hopefully they can get you sorted out and I do have another small little update on the store

02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:33.940
Uh, zack actually announced an ltt color version of the jerry rig everything

02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:37.140
Razor knife, so we don't have it in stock yet. Apparently

02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:39.780
Thanks, zack

02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:43.300
But we're going to have it and uh, you guys can

02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:47.620
Check out. I think it's his most recent video where he announced that so that's pretty cool. Cool

02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:51.860
And I think that's pretty much it for today

02:07:52.740 --> 02:07:56.340
Sorry guys, it has to be a short show. We got to get to the airport. See you again next week

02:07:57.380 --> 02:07:58.500
Oh

02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:00.500
Same bad time

02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:02.580
Different bad location

02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:06.660
But same channel same channel. I'll still be here. Bye

02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:08.660
Bye

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:31.140
Thanks, vessie signal wiring Corsair for sponsoring the show

02:08:36.660 --> 02:08:39.060
