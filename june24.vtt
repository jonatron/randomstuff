WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I

00:03.520 --> 00:05.520
Hello

00:19.080 --> 00:21.080
Bum bum bum

00:21.080 --> 00:26.220
People are saying finally, but this isn't really the show. This is the Paris show

00:27.220 --> 00:31.380
This is the show that we do while Linus isn't here because we don't know where Linus is

00:40.940 --> 00:45.180
Actual pre-show, yeah, have we not had a pre-show for a while

00:47.340 --> 00:49.180
Yeah

00:49.180 --> 00:50.740
It's not ideal

00:50.740 --> 00:53.540
So yeah, this is actually the natural pre-show pre-show

00:54.540 --> 00:56.540
We don't know when we'll be live pre-show

00:58.500 --> 01:01.500
Where's the real pre-show this is the real pre-show four months

01:01.500 --> 01:04.580
I don't know if it's been four months since we've had a pre-show. That doesn't sound right

01:06.140 --> 01:08.140
It does sound right

01:15.500 --> 01:17.500
You that is right, I don't know

01:21.340 --> 01:23.340
Yes four months really

01:23.540 --> 01:25.540
I haven't had

01:27.220 --> 01:30.140
Huh, okay

01:36.740 --> 01:42.740
Bees looking better. Yeah, I did nothing to it since last show literally genuinely nothing this is just growth

01:43.740 --> 01:45.740
And it is better. You are right

01:46.740 --> 01:48.940
Perfect welcome Linus to the show

01:50.060 --> 01:51.860
finally here

01:51.860 --> 01:58.460
It was in the n64 inspired screwdrivers. Yes any chance it would fancy the Linus what?

02:01.140 --> 02:03.140
Huh

02:08.300 --> 02:13.620
Also don't spam you post it that twice in a row you just need to post it once

02:16.620 --> 02:20.820
If Linus might make them I thought we I thought we are I thought that's the whole point

02:22.860 --> 02:24.860
Am I missing something

02:40.020 --> 02:42.020
Maybe I miss something

02:42.220 --> 02:44.220
I

02:48.340 --> 02:54.420
Sounds good night. Huck is this 4k. I don't know. Oh wait, I do know it's a live stream. No, it's not

02:56.100 --> 02:58.100
Oops

02:58.380 --> 03:01.860
I was gonna say it depends on what to your subscribe to and then I'm like wait no it doesn't

03:04.380 --> 03:06.380
Got him

03:07.380 --> 03:14.500
Did you read some ridiculous questions from FTC to against Microsoft no

03:14.820 --> 03:21.540
But anytime any tech company or really any company that does anything as far as I can tell

03:21.900 --> 03:28.060
Meets with the government the government just asks extremely out of touch obviously dumb questions. So it's not too surprising

03:36.700 --> 03:43.220
Are you excited for the Elon versus Zuckerberg fight, I don't think it's actually gonna happen. I don't think

03:46.780 --> 03:51.860
Drop your lifts, what are you even talking about? Yeah, I don't think do you think it's gonna happen. I don't think so

03:53.820 --> 03:55.820
Yeah, probably not no

03:58.060 --> 04:00.060
There's no way

04:00.100 --> 04:02.740
Elon would just get freaking pounded dude like it's

04:03.740 --> 04:08.940
I mean with like Zuckerberg's gone insane like he's a yeah

04:08.940 --> 04:15.460
Well, yeah, I know and it's like steel bones and like new actuators are gonna like just go right through Elon

04:15.580 --> 04:16.780
Yeah

04:16.780 --> 04:23.060
Yeah, unless like unless that would be kind of funny if it ended up being like robot versus robot. Oh

04:25.820 --> 04:27.820
Yeah, that would be that would be great

04:33.580 --> 04:39.300
Did you see Andrew sighs video calling Linus out on him and Emily's Mac gaming video no

04:42.980 --> 04:44.980
No

04:46.540 --> 04:50.980
Sorry, I don't even I don't full transparency

04:50.980 --> 04:55.900
I barely even watch our own videos let alone other people's videos on our videos, you know

04:55.900 --> 04:59.380
Like that's that's multiple layers beyond how far how far I go

04:59.860 --> 05:01.860
You know

05:02.180 --> 05:05.540
Dana White spoke with them and thinks they are being serious about the fight

05:10.060 --> 05:19.860
You know, I hope they do it because a couple billionaires taking any amount of brain damage is like probably a good thing

05:23.300 --> 05:26.460
You know, I don't know screw it whatever I'm getting that

05:30.380 --> 05:35.500
I don't care though, I don't want to like pay them. I don't want to buy a pay-per-view ticket

05:35.500 --> 05:37.980
I don't want to pay some billionaires to do stupid stuff

05:39.260 --> 05:44.740
If they like stream it for free, I might watch them incur some amount of brain damage that might be entertaining

05:52.060 --> 05:54.060
Three billionaires just did

05:54.460 --> 05:56.460
I

05:57.020 --> 06:01.140
Real are we allowed are we allowed to joke about that yet? Is that okay? I don't know

06:01.620 --> 06:06.460
I don't know. I'm gonna I'm gonna be unspecific. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna specify what I'm just gonna leave it there

06:06.460 --> 06:08.700
Because I don't know I think that's probably the best plan. Yeah

06:14.660 --> 06:18.460
They should bet their platforms, yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen

06:20.300 --> 06:23.420
One losing social media platform against another

06:25.060 --> 06:29.860
They announced it would be a hundred dollar PPV with donations for charity

06:29.860 --> 06:34.700
I mean, I still have a hard time believing they're even gonna do this dude if they did do that though

06:34.700 --> 06:39.140
I'm still not paying for it. Even if even it's like, oh proceeds go to charity. Yeah, except

06:39.660 --> 06:43.460
Someone's taking a fee somewhere there. That's how life works

06:43.460 --> 06:49.700
So like if it's like UFC is hosting this or whatever. Yeah, well, UFC is gonna get their cut and

06:50.180 --> 06:57.660
Then the extra whatever bit off the top, maybe that goes to charity sure but some but somebody's gonna gonna take from this

06:58.060 --> 07:00.340
So I'm still not giving money to it now

07:00.380 --> 07:07.180
I'm certain there will be highlight clips on YouTube or a bunch of privateer streams on the internet and maybe

07:07.860 --> 07:11.140
Potentially I could enjoy I could enjoy it that way

07:12.060 --> 07:18.140
Luke versus nebula our CEO fight. Okay. Well, I'm pretty sure you're talking about nebula for one and then two

07:18.140 --> 07:20.140
I have no interest in this

07:20.220 --> 07:25.420
Luke versus Theo versus Theo. I don't want to hit Theo. I

07:29.180 --> 07:31.180
Don't want to fight anybody. I

07:32.420 --> 07:35.420
Like to know how and then just not do it. You want to fight these bugs

07:36.540 --> 07:39.940
Get them out of production. Okay. I mean if we can if we can

07:41.500 --> 07:45.900
Starship troopers I'll sign up for that. I'll sign up for the fight against the bugs, you know

07:46.500 --> 07:51.220
But I was sort of that. No, not interested

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
Linus versus as been called

08:08.420 --> 08:10.300
It's like

08:10.340 --> 08:15.900
Someone who fights for what is it? Oh, man, I'm trying to use 40k references, but I don't know 40k

08:15.900 --> 08:19.440
I was gonna say like a rejected space marine versus a

08:19.820 --> 08:21.820
Plague Lord

08:23.260 --> 08:27.400
He's too short to be a space marine and he's just stinky enough to be a Plague Lord

08:28.700 --> 08:30.700
Growth hormones didn't work

08:41.260 --> 08:47.660
Do you think Linus is aware of the internet comment etiquette challenged him to a match months ago?

08:47.980 --> 08:51.700
No, probably not. I don't think either of us are interested in this at all

08:55.340 --> 08:57.900
Sorry that came through the mic a lot more than I thought it would

09:04.220 --> 09:07.940
So a stunty versus a great unclean one, yeah, there you go

09:10.300 --> 09:12.300
You

09:24.140 --> 09:30.860
Linus Luke and Linus versus Nvidia leadership, I'd fight Jensen there you go

09:32.980 --> 09:38.380
I'll do that. He can wear his leather jacket too. I'll use it

09:40.300 --> 09:42.300
I

09:47.180 --> 09:49.420
Give the proceeds to hardware and boxed

09:57.740 --> 10:01.420
Creators don't need to fight they get enough brain damage reading YouTube comments. Yeah, this is like, I don't know

10:01.980 --> 10:04.380
I I've always thought it's stupid. I I think

10:04.460 --> 10:06.460
Um

10:06.700 --> 10:12.780
I think random people engaging in actual boxing matches is kind of not a good idea

10:15.100 --> 10:19.180
For the same reason so I think slap is a is a terrible idea

10:21.180 --> 10:25.260
This is unnecessary. I don't know how this trend really took off

10:28.460 --> 10:32.220
I guess it was mostly Logan and KSI wasn't it? I think so at least I don't know

10:32.700 --> 10:35.180
But either way, I thought it's like kind of dumb the whole time

10:39.660 --> 10:41.660
Linus and Luke boxing match no

10:44.460 --> 10:46.460
It's not gonna happen

10:48.700 --> 10:53.980
Luke is into leather confirmed. No, I was I was trying to suggest he could wear it so I could use it on him

10:54.140 --> 10:56.140
Use it against him. It's a joke. Come on

10:57.020 --> 10:59.020
Yeah, I'll be fine

11:03.340 --> 11:07.580
Have you heard of ghosts of tabour or tabour or whatever? Yes, I have heard of it

11:14.060 --> 11:21.660
Only Luke today, no, this is just a pre-show so I'm just basically hanging out with you guys because we're you know an hour and a half late or whatever

11:22.620 --> 11:24.620
Um

11:25.100 --> 11:29.420
And I'm trying to give you guys a little bit of extra time even though it is just me

11:29.980 --> 11:31.980
I know people want to see Linus

11:32.060 --> 11:35.580
But I'm trying to give you guys a little bit of extra time because Linus has a heart out today

11:35.980 --> 11:37.980
Because he has a flight to catch

11:38.220 --> 11:41.500
So the stream is going to have a hard cap despite the fact that

11:42.140 --> 11:43.420
Um

11:43.420 --> 11:46.780
We are starting late. So it is going to be a short show today

11:47.580 --> 11:49.580
If I remember correctly

11:49.820 --> 11:53.340
Wait, I probably shouldn't say the time because people on the internet are weird

11:53.740 --> 11:57.660
But yeah, he has to be at the airport at a at a time at a specific time

12:01.340 --> 12:04.860
I appreciate I was actually not fishing for compliments, but I do appreciate

12:07.420 --> 12:10.300
But I was just saying like I'm trying to I'm trying to I'm trying to do something

12:10.300 --> 12:15.020
You know trying to hang out a little bit something. I knew you guys were waiting. Um, I didn't have a ton going on

12:15.740 --> 12:19.180
Either I could like go back to the other building where my desk is and start working or I could just hang out

12:19.180 --> 12:21.180
On a pre-show. So I was like, whatever I'll do that

12:21.420 --> 12:23.420
How much do you lift? It depends on the lift, brother

12:26.380 --> 12:30.540
And probably not as much as you think because my main goal is like injury aversion

12:34.460 --> 12:37.180
Has anything fundamentally changed in the organization since the hack

12:37.660 --> 12:42.780
Um, sort of indirectly I was already brought in to try to do cto stuff before the hack

12:42.860 --> 12:46.380
But had no real time before the hack to actually do any things and nothing really changed

12:46.940 --> 12:49.340
Um, and since then some stuff has changed

12:49.660 --> 12:51.660
Um

12:51.900 --> 12:56.060
I wouldn't say that we are currently at a point of resilience that I am proud of

12:56.620 --> 12:59.180
But we are on the path to eventually get there, which is good

13:01.260 --> 13:03.260
This line is going to call in

13:04.380 --> 13:07.020
From the head camp thing. I don't really know what you're talking about. Sorry

13:09.100 --> 13:11.100
Oh, I'm losing stuff

13:11.580 --> 13:15.820
If you're both out, will you both call in with the face call robot?

13:17.340 --> 13:21.340
I feel like I missed an episode or something. I'm not sure what you guys are talking about

13:21.740 --> 13:27.580
Um, but if you if you if you watch the taiwan show, um, you'll know how it works if we're both out

13:27.660 --> 13:29.660
I guess it's if we're both out in the same location

13:31.340 --> 13:35.340
I don't really know how it would work if we were both out in different locations. We'll figure it out though

13:35.900 --> 13:45.500
Was there any float plane news that came out of copy text? Um, not particularly. I was mostly just

13:46.060 --> 13:50.220
Meeting with creators and informing them that they can use float plane in a variety of ways

13:50.860 --> 13:54.620
A lot of creators aren't super aware of the creator sub channels feature. So I was making sure they knew

13:57.820 --> 14:02.140
You ever fix your washer only getting hot water figured out, uh, no

14:03.100 --> 14:08.540
So I somehow packed everything except for shirts when I went to taiwan. I had to buy shirts while I was in taiwan

14:09.100 --> 14:12.780
Um, and then I brought them back and I put them in the washer and now they are all too small

14:14.700 --> 14:16.700
So that sucks they were fine when I was there

14:17.980 --> 14:19.980
but yeah

14:20.140 --> 14:22.140
What are we doing float plane merch? I don't know

14:22.860 --> 14:26.300
I don't remember. There's like there's something blocking it, but I don't remember what it is

14:27.340 --> 14:29.340
Why do you keep saying we had?

14:30.300 --> 14:34.220
We had what is that? Do you know what that is? Oh, yeah, what is that?

14:39.020 --> 14:42.220
Um, it was a short circuit that linus did recently

14:42.620 --> 14:50.380
Um, I had to fix it because it was broken. It's basically four samsung phones duct taped to a 3d printed head with actuators on it

14:50.780 --> 14:55.820
Cool and uh, you can do a remote call and like look around and have it to a conversation

14:56.380 --> 14:59.900
So in future when we do remote stuff, I think I'm just gonna plop it on the desk

15:02.300 --> 15:06.460
That sounds horrible. It's uh, it's pretty horrific. You should watch the white plastic. Yeah

15:06.700 --> 15:11.740
Okay, someone tweeted me a picture today of like my face on this weird thing. That's the we head. Yes

15:11.740 --> 15:15.100
And I was like, what is this? How am I supposed to know what this is? Okay, that makes sense

15:15.180 --> 15:18.380
Basically, you see that head sitting across from you. It would be like that

15:18.860 --> 15:21.100
That would be the way on samsung phones. Yeah

15:21.820 --> 15:24.300
And your face on it and you could look around the room and like

15:25.100 --> 15:30.700
You could have it sitting in front of your laptop and like read the the laptop and then look up and over to linus and

15:31.900 --> 15:35.660
That sounds really expensive and also bad. What were they like? They're like

15:36.540 --> 15:38.540
three grand or something

15:38.540 --> 15:44.620
So got four samsung phones in it. I'm just gonna exactly what I just said. It sounds really expensive and bad

15:46.940 --> 15:48.940
It's uh, it's also horrifying

15:51.100 --> 15:53.100
I

15:54.860 --> 15:56.860
See

16:05.820 --> 16:10.620
What are flowplanes plans for fast? I mean it's parked right now. Um, but

16:11.500 --> 16:13.500
ideally eventually we would be able to

16:14.540 --> 16:18.460
Hand people a package that is effectively float plane, but

16:19.260 --> 16:20.540
um

16:20.540 --> 16:22.540
able to be

16:23.900 --> 16:25.100
Set up for anyone

16:25.100 --> 16:26.300
so like

16:26.300 --> 16:30.860
Say short circuit was a different company like we had no idea who they were we'd never worked with them

16:30.860 --> 16:34.620
We didn't know anyone that was there and short circuit was like, hey, we like float plane

16:35.180 --> 16:39.660
But we don't want to be on float plane.com slash short circuit. We want to be on short circuit.com

16:40.860 --> 16:42.860
But we want all the float plane

16:43.020 --> 16:45.020
Stuff

16:45.260 --> 16:46.220
And we'd be like, okay

16:46.220 --> 16:51.740
Well, it's gonna cost you more than if you were just on float plane because it's more complicated and more difficult and yada yada yada

16:52.460 --> 16:57.020
But we can do that for you. That's that's the idea behind fast. Um, but again, it's parked right now

16:58.300 --> 17:01.020
So maybe we'll do it someday. Maybe we won't who knows

17:01.740 --> 17:04.220
We're also pushing a lot of float plane notifications right now

17:06.060 --> 17:08.300
Either somebody's uploading a whole bunch of videos

17:11.100 --> 17:13.100
Or

17:13.820 --> 17:20.780
Considering none of my people are in full plane chat freaking out. It's probably fine. Yeah, it just looks like there are a lot of bunch of videos

17:27.100 --> 17:29.100
Why I don't know

17:32.060 --> 17:37.500
Um, all right. Well, have you approved the behind the scenes for wancho yet? Yeah, like three times

17:38.300 --> 17:39.740
Okay

17:39.740 --> 17:43.100
When is it gonna be posted? I don't know should message, uh

17:44.060 --> 17:46.060
Social about that. I guess monday, maybe

17:47.580 --> 17:49.580
Oh riley was uploading

17:50.220 --> 17:52.220
All good. Thank you riley

17:57.980 --> 18:04.700
Does that mean i'm not doing it after the show, you know, I have uh, I have your chat open. What's wrong with me?

18:05.340 --> 18:07.340
I

18:08.860 --> 18:10.860
Use an iphone no

18:11.100 --> 18:13.820
I didn't see you in any compi-text videos. What were you doing there float plane stuff?

18:13.980 --> 18:19.180
I wouldn't you just do what you guys did back during covid although

18:19.260 --> 18:24.060
I suppose a best boy dan wasn't a factor back then. Um, yeah

18:24.140 --> 18:27.020
I know we'd try to do something a little bit better, but it would probably be similar

18:27.740 --> 18:31.580
You need to need to cold wash. Yeah, it was on very cold

18:32.140 --> 18:35.180
Water was on the I think it's called very very cold or whatever

18:35.180 --> 18:36.940
It's the bottom setting for water

18:37.020 --> 18:40.140
It was on that and then it still shrank and it didn't shrank

18:40.620 --> 18:44.780
When I washed them in taiwan because I was there for two weeks and I bought like one week worth of shirts

18:45.660 --> 18:49.660
Um, actually I had this shirt because this is a shirt that I wore to taiwan

18:49.660 --> 18:53.660
So I had this shirt and then no other shirts. So I bought one week minus one worth of shirts

18:53.980 --> 18:56.940
So one week in I went and washed all of them and they were all fine

18:56.940 --> 19:01.340
None of them shrank at all and then I came home put on the lowest possible temperature setting and every single one of them

19:01.340 --> 19:02.940
shrank

19:02.940 --> 19:04.940
It's awesome

19:13.100 --> 19:17.420
What's your favorite thing I kind of be ducks, um, just hanging out with creators. Yeah

19:19.900 --> 19:21.900
Watch the video quick now

19:22.060 --> 19:26.060
Do a live everyone wants me to do a live reaction. I don't know about that

19:27.020 --> 19:32.700
Anyone sign up for flow plane or is there a sub reach minimum? Uh, there's kind of like a sub reach minimum

19:32.700 --> 19:37.500
Yeah, it's just it doesn't make sense for either side at a certain size. It's not really sub

19:38.620 --> 19:40.620
amount

19:40.700 --> 19:43.420
We we kind of make an assessment because like there's some people

19:44.460 --> 19:46.460
um

19:47.340 --> 19:49.340
Are their numbers public hold on

19:50.220 --> 19:58.380
Yeah, so like if you look at level one text if you look at the fact that they have a patreon

19:58.460 --> 20:00.620
You see the amount of people that are subscribed to their patreon

20:02.460 --> 20:06.140
And then he realized that they also have a float plane so they have two external subscription platforms

20:07.500 --> 20:09.500
Sorry, I'm very backed up

20:10.220 --> 20:12.220
Um, or that's the wrong

20:12.300 --> 20:14.300
I

20:18.460 --> 20:20.460
Want a flam

20:23.580 --> 20:27.020
Yeah, if you look at the amount of subscribers level one text has on patreon and then also look that they have

20:27.580 --> 20:30.460
852 on float plane as well and then look at the amount of

20:30.940 --> 20:36.460
Views and subscribers that they have on youtube their ratios are amazing like they they pull a fantastic

20:37.100 --> 20:39.100
fantastic percentage of

20:39.900 --> 20:44.940
Of their users into into paid subscribers that is very uncommon amounts of conversion

20:45.500 --> 20:48.540
And that's because they have like a super dedicated very

20:49.500 --> 20:51.500
enthusiast slash

20:51.580 --> 20:53.100
professional

20:53.100 --> 20:54.300
user base

20:54.300 --> 20:58.620
Not a super like casual user base or fan base. Whatever you want to call it

21:00.060 --> 21:05.580
So they they have very high conversion. There's also some other groups. There's one group that i'm talking to right now

21:05.980 --> 21:07.980
Um

21:08.220 --> 21:12.780
That have very low like subscribers and stuff online because that's not even their target

21:13.260 --> 21:16.300
They are how do I describe this without saying who it is?

21:18.140 --> 21:20.140
Um

21:20.140 --> 21:22.140
They have a facility in real life

21:23.260 --> 21:25.260
and they train

21:26.140 --> 21:31.900
At that facility i'm just gonna say train they train at that facility and they also do online training

21:32.460 --> 21:38.860
And they have some free stuff on their youtube channel, whatever, but their main thing is like paid training

21:39.420 --> 21:41.500
Um, so they want to create kind of a middle

21:42.460 --> 21:44.460
They see right now that they have

21:46.300 --> 21:48.060
Three tiers

21:48.060 --> 21:50.860
They have the high tier which is like in-person training

21:51.580 --> 21:52.860
Then they have

21:52.860 --> 21:59.020
The medium tier which is online courses like dedicated courses training and they have the free tier

21:59.020 --> 22:02.940
Which is their youtube channel they want another one which is kind of like in the middle, which is

22:03.580 --> 22:08.940
Uh subscription access to some more premium videos, but it's not one-on-one training online

22:09.020 --> 22:11.020
It's not it's not direct training in person

22:11.740 --> 22:12.780
So it's like, okay cool

22:12.780 --> 22:17.180
We can work with with them because this is like a business that is trying to execute a business plan

22:17.900 --> 22:21.820
Based around a paying pre-existing subscriber base stuff like that

22:22.460 --> 22:26.380
So like that's that's interesting if if you're a content creator

22:27.340 --> 22:36.060
And you're a fairly like normal type of content creator not like hyper hyper professional and enthusiast level viewers like level one techs

22:39.420 --> 22:41.420
Somewhere in the middle

22:41.420 --> 22:45.180
There's kind of an amount that you should be at before you join flow plane

22:45.900 --> 22:49.820
This also means there is kind of an amount that you should be at before you join patreon

22:50.140 --> 22:53.740
They just let anyone join, but it's not good for you

22:54.380 --> 22:56.380
And it's not good for patreon

22:57.100 --> 23:01.100
So we try to kind of guiding light people a little bit more instead of just letting everyone join

23:01.580 --> 23:06.460
We kind of go like you should invest more of your time growing this pre-existing thing first

23:06.780 --> 23:10.220
Because if you join us you're going to spend a bunch of time working on flow plane as well

23:11.180 --> 23:15.180
But due to tiny percentage audience conversion all this other type of stuff

23:15.260 --> 23:17.420
It's like it's going to be a waste of your time

23:19.900 --> 23:22.220
So you should not do this basically

23:23.740 --> 23:27.820
Is the titanic sub a topic today? I think I voted for it to not be oh

23:27.820 --> 23:32.700
I put it in rapid rapid fire because I want to talk about like the controller, but that's it. I don't want to talk about anything else

23:34.060 --> 23:36.860
I don't think there's any value in us talking about anything else

23:39.900 --> 23:43.020
Who's your favorite flow plane creator they're all my favorite flow plane creators

23:43.980 --> 23:45.900
all of them

23:45.900 --> 23:49.100
Any plans any float plane plans or ltx everyone

23:49.900 --> 23:53.100
Is coming out except for one person two people

23:54.700 --> 23:56.700
Most most people are coming out

24:02.140 --> 24:04.540
Well, I've got a merge message here for you luke

24:05.340 --> 24:09.580
All that float plane chat sound when someone at you doesn't work. I don't think

24:11.820 --> 24:16.060
I don't think we have a sound for that. Is that a twitch feature that you're assuming we have or something

24:16.140 --> 24:18.140
I don't know what that is

24:19.740 --> 24:21.500
What's up

24:21.580 --> 24:26.220
Merge message for you. Hmm any interest in using float plane to stream business content

24:26.620 --> 24:30.620
I currently pay a fortune for what I consider low usage training videos for my business

24:30.940 --> 24:32.940
So staff don't get commercials

24:36.300 --> 24:38.300
Hmm

24:39.020 --> 24:41.020
So we can do that um

24:42.620 --> 24:48.300
I'm just trying to figure because you're talking these are so these are I can't have a back and forth with this person

24:48.940 --> 24:50.940
um

24:51.740 --> 24:53.740
You

24:56.540 --> 25:01.580
Message support at full plane.com. Maybe it depends on like the scale and stuff

25:04.540 --> 25:06.300
But yeah

25:06.300 --> 25:11.820
Message them with how many employees you have because these are message them answering is this

25:12.940 --> 25:16.300
Internal only so only employees should be able to see this

25:17.100 --> 25:21.660
Uh, because right now all creators on full plane are subscribers by standard users

25:22.220 --> 25:23.260
um

25:23.260 --> 25:25.260
And then if this is internal only

25:26.060 --> 25:31.740
How many use how many people would be viewing it? And then uh, if you're okay with sharing this information

25:31.740 --> 25:36.460
what is your current contract price with the company that you're using to stream your stuff because

25:38.460 --> 25:43.740
Um, the reason why I'm asking you to include that last part is because if these should be private only

25:44.700 --> 25:45.740
then

25:45.740 --> 25:51.020
Uh, we're gonna have to do some amount of custom work because if it's if it's not private only you don't care

25:51.100 --> 25:52.940
If someone else happened to subscribe to it

25:52.940 --> 25:54.940
We can just add use of hope and greater and who cares

25:55.340 --> 25:59.180
Uh, but if it has to be private then we'd have to have you as like an unlisted creator

25:59.340 --> 26:04.380
So other people can't find it and things get like a little weird and stuff and like it's still it's still fine

26:04.380 --> 26:06.940
But it's much more hands-on so we'd have to come up with some custom pricing

26:07.260 --> 26:14.460
And uh, if if we can't beat what you're already paying, there's no point in us pursuing the conversation. So yeah, I don't know

26:15.340 --> 26:21.900
I understand that last ask is like a little annoying. Um, and sounds like it could be easily abused and it could

26:22.620 --> 26:25.740
That's not my goal though. I'm just trying to make sure neither of us waste our time

26:36.940 --> 26:38.940
I

26:48.140 --> 26:50.140
Just giving through chat really quick

26:54.140 --> 27:02.300
Bird update birds are doing good. Um, it seems like the demighting has worked. It's been a few weeks since then a month

27:03.740 --> 27:05.740
I think it's been a month since then

27:07.420 --> 27:14.220
Yeah, they seem to be doing good. They're annoyed right now because I left the house today and they're like

27:16.380 --> 27:18.380
Uh, but that's normal

27:18.620 --> 27:21.100
But yeah, they're doing good other than that. They're not they're not itching as much

27:21.820 --> 27:24.940
We before we realized it was mites. We just thought they were molting

27:25.500 --> 27:27.100
um

27:27.100 --> 27:28.620
Because they were shitting a lot of feathers

27:28.620 --> 27:32.860
But it turned out they were shitting feathers because they were losing weight because they were not doing well because the mites

27:34.060 --> 27:36.060
Not great, but they're doing well now

27:37.580 --> 27:39.580
You

27:55.340 --> 27:59.420
I think your mic is picking up some background noise. Yeah, it's loud in here. I don't know what else to say

28:00.780 --> 28:03.100
They're just like is background noise. There's a lot of buzzing

28:04.140 --> 28:06.140
What is that buzzing by the way?

28:07.020 --> 28:13.500
That's the transformer for this room. Makes sense. Uh, after we moved out logistics, it's very noisy in here

28:13.740 --> 28:17.180
Yeah, I'd like to sonopan the ceiling which I think would fix a lot of the issues

28:18.700 --> 28:20.460
But

28:20.460 --> 28:22.460
When is that going to happen, you know?

28:26.460 --> 28:30.460
It's uh less noticeable when Linus is screaming for four hours straight

28:37.020 --> 28:39.020
You

28:47.020 --> 28:49.900
So if I'm starting out can I not join full plane, correct?

28:52.540 --> 28:54.540
Sorry if that's annoying it's just

28:55.420 --> 29:00.220
It's not worth it on either side. It doesn't make any sense if you're just starting out you need to be

29:01.180 --> 29:05.420
laser focused on audience growth and like nothing else

29:05.980 --> 29:09.580
And joining float plane is not audience growth. It just isn't

29:13.740 --> 29:17.660
And if you join float plane while you have one youtube subscriber

29:19.180 --> 29:21.180
It's just

29:21.420 --> 29:24.060
What was the point even if you join float plane when you have

29:26.060 --> 29:32.140
10 000 youtube subscribers if you're getting 0.01 conversion or something. I don't know

29:32.220 --> 29:34.220
I don't even remember what the conversion numbers are

29:35.100 --> 29:38.220
Um, I actually used to use patreon's calculator on their website

29:39.020 --> 29:42.540
Because it was basically the same for us because it's like it's a very similar thing, right?

29:43.180 --> 29:46.300
Um, but I don't remember what percentage they talk about. Um

29:47.660 --> 29:51.340
But whatever the conversion is even at 10 000 subscribers, it's still really bad

29:52.140 --> 29:54.940
You you need like a a solid amount of people

29:56.060 --> 29:58.620
Think about it, right? Because like if you look at the line of sectives channel

29:59.340 --> 30:03.340
Like we have a ton of float plane subscribers. It's a lot of money. It does this does really well for us, right?

30:03.740 --> 30:09.180
We have 41 282 subscribers on float plane. That's sweet. The main channel has like

30:10.220 --> 30:14.540
Is it like almost 16 million? Yeah. Yeah, so like

30:17.500 --> 30:24.620
Whoa, right like not that many people are gonna go off of a free platform and pay for a paid platform

30:24.700 --> 30:28.460
Even when if you look at the line of media group channel, there's all these like

30:29.100 --> 30:33.660
Really pretty sweet float plane exclusives are like almost 300 of them or something

30:33.980 --> 30:37.180
Like there's a lot of like really sick content you can get in addition

30:37.820 --> 30:39.820
And still the conversion rate is that low

30:40.380 --> 30:42.380
It's just gonna be really low

30:44.300 --> 30:46.300
And if you're making

30:46.700 --> 30:48.700
$4 a month off of float plane

30:49.740 --> 30:52.940
Like why why did you even spend the time to put the banner on the website?

30:53.020 --> 30:57.500
You should be spending that time growing your audience doing everything you can to grow your audience

30:59.260 --> 31:09.020
Did you see the stream this week? No, I was working actually no that was yesterday. I had the day off because of

31:10.860 --> 31:12.860
Reasons I'm not going to go over

31:14.780 --> 31:17.340
Are the birds gonna be at LTX? No, definitely not

31:19.180 --> 31:21.180
I'd love to see pictures of your birds

31:21.660 --> 31:23.660
I think we're doing a

31:24.060 --> 31:25.980
sticker pack

31:25.980 --> 31:28.540
I think a sticker pack. I think they're gonna be included in a sticker pack

31:33.900 --> 31:41.500
Have you replaced your desk chair yet? No, unfortunately not. I haven't had the time when I got back

31:44.380 --> 31:46.380
I was still kind of unwell for a little while

31:47.980 --> 31:49.980
And then some some pretty serious

31:50.780 --> 31:52.780
personal life things happened with

31:53.260 --> 31:55.260
someone in my family

31:56.060 --> 31:57.580
and then

31:57.580 --> 32:00.620
That's still going on. I've had like no time for anything

32:04.220 --> 32:10.780
Have you taken precautions for them for fire season? Very possible very bad air. Yes lots actually we have some like very serious

32:11.900 --> 32:15.500
Like medical grade HEPA filters. We have multiple of them that

32:16.140 --> 32:18.140
control all the hair hair

32:18.780 --> 32:20.380
sort of

32:20.380 --> 32:22.380
That control all the air in my apartment

32:26.940 --> 32:30.860
Any update on the possibility of bringing back scrapper doors? No, I haven't heard anything new

32:47.260 --> 32:53.500
Did you read the Microsoft paper about Orca? I think I heard it came out but have not read it

32:56.540 --> 33:05.260
Switch chairs with line. Oh, they are different

33:08.220 --> 33:10.220
That'd be pretty funny, but no I'm good

33:15.500 --> 33:18.700
We have a meet the birds float plate inclusive there is

33:20.300 --> 33:24.780
I think I think it's actually been fairly recently locked down so you can't find it anymore

33:25.340 --> 33:29.340
But there is a video on float plane of my my first bird to keto

33:30.620 --> 33:36.300
That I used as like an upload test one time and some user found a way to find it

33:37.980 --> 33:43.020
I think it's been hidden since then though. It's still technically there like I can go to it, but I think it's been access controlled

33:43.020 --> 33:45.020
I

33:52.700 --> 33:56.140
As long as this mic active probably yep

34:00.860 --> 34:04.860
I think so I think people are figuring that might be where the background noise is coming from

34:05.180 --> 34:11.500
Did you also go to the arcade and mini golf? No, I was still

34:12.380 --> 34:17.180
It was kind of unlikely, but I was still potentially contagious at that time. So I did not go

34:25.180 --> 34:29.660
What water bottle should I get 64 ounce? I think you answered your own thing

34:30.220 --> 34:35.260
I love the big one. I have a 64 ounce at home and I have a 64 ounce at work

34:35.980 --> 34:37.980
And then I have this one on the show

34:39.420 --> 34:41.420
And yeah, that's my use

34:42.380 --> 34:45.580
I'm just gonna mute Linus's mic. Could you tap it a couple times for me, please?

34:50.140 --> 34:52.540
Harder okay, that's good. Thank you

34:59.660 --> 35:05.740
Was I reading? Oh, well I appear in upcoming videos. Yeah, I was in something recently that was weird

35:05.980 --> 35:09.020
It was very unplanned and my involvement was honestly like not great

35:10.220 --> 35:12.860
Just be being transparent here. It was um

35:14.940 --> 35:18.380
You'll have to wait and see because I don't know if I can say what it was to be honest. Yeah

35:19.340 --> 35:21.340
It was something

35:21.660 --> 35:25.980
Uh, yeah, I just kind of like sat there and reacted to things while Linus did stuff

35:26.300 --> 35:28.780
Uh, the whole time I was sitting there. I was like this is

35:29.660 --> 35:31.660
My involvement here is not good

35:32.220 --> 35:35.580
But uh, hopefully hopefully the audience doesn't pick up on that too much

35:38.620 --> 35:40.620
If I was new to the market

35:40.700 --> 35:42.700
But wanted to do a float plane account

35:43.500 --> 35:45.500
And a short youtube account

35:46.140 --> 35:50.460
But make my main videos float plane only by not be allowed to be a float plane member

35:51.100 --> 35:53.100
Uh, correct because that's a

35:53.900 --> 35:55.900
That's a bad idea

35:56.620 --> 35:58.620
Um

35:58.940 --> 36:00.940
Just do the shorts

36:01.180 --> 36:03.180
And grow an audience

36:03.180 --> 36:09.260
But then once you have a good audience then sure sounds good, but you gotta you gotta grow that audience first

36:25.900 --> 36:29.660
Anything from the nintendo direct peaker fancy. I honestly did not watch it

36:31.580 --> 36:36.700
I did not I did not watch it. I've been very focused. So starfield

36:39.500 --> 36:41.500
Oh boy

36:42.060 --> 36:44.140
The excitement train on that one is fast

36:44.940 --> 36:50.380
Long and made of extremely dense metals. Um, if you get my reference there, um

36:52.620 --> 36:55.020
And also final fantasy 16

36:56.140 --> 36:58.860
I'm not usually like that into final fantasy games, but

37:00.060 --> 37:02.380
I also known as I've played almost none of them

37:03.100 --> 37:04.300
but

37:04.300 --> 37:07.980
It looks really cool and lots of people are saying that it's supposed to be really good

37:08.620 --> 37:15.900
So maybe I'll pick that up. I'm sure even just mentioning that will mean that I will hear much about it from conrad, which sounds good to me

37:16.540 --> 37:19.980
Ah, the next thing someone asked was any interest in playing in final fantasy 16?

37:20.380 --> 37:25.020
I didn't really until fairly recently. I'm hearing a lot of very good things about it

37:25.580 --> 37:30.060
I've heard the reviews are really fantastic. By the way, if you guys are posting right now, it's gonna take me a while to react to it

37:30.060 --> 37:32.060
I'm like way scrolled up

37:33.660 --> 37:37.340
But uh, yeah, I don't know. I'm gonna look into it

37:38.140 --> 37:41.420
I've had like no real time to game for the last bit, but I will look into it

37:43.260 --> 37:51.020
Yeah 0.26 subscriber conversion rate for lttm flow plane and I will say if I remember correctly that is statistically like very good

37:51.340 --> 37:55.900
That is good. Yeah for external account conversion. I'm pretty sure it's usually like less than half of that

37:56.460 --> 37:58.700
so

37:58.700 --> 38:00.060
Yeah

38:00.060 --> 38:03.100
I think you're looking around 0.1 and often below

38:03.980 --> 38:08.140
Um, and this isn't just for flow, but this is for patreon. This is for buying merch

38:08.780 --> 38:12.940
This is for every all all external stuff. It's all really really low. You need

38:13.820 --> 38:18.620
tens of thousands if not more before any of this stuff really becomes worth doing

38:19.580 --> 38:24.780
There's a reason you don't see a lot of creators spin up patreons or flow planes or

38:25.660 --> 38:29.340
Even merch stores anything like that until they're at over a hundred k

38:30.620 --> 38:32.220
subscribers

38:32.220 --> 38:37.020
The subscriber count really doesn't matter that much if I'm being honest. That's just kind of a vague benchmark

38:37.180 --> 38:42.700
It's mostly the engaged viewership and subscriber count is a way to measure that but it's honestly

38:43.420 --> 38:46.220
These days not a very good one. It used to be very good, but not anymore

38:48.620 --> 38:50.620
I

38:50.940 --> 38:54.860
Think your discussion last week or week before about starfield has

38:55.740 --> 38:59.420
Ruined me because I was on the reserved expectations

39:00.140 --> 39:01.980
And you're like shut up dan. It's gonna be great

39:01.980 --> 39:05.180
But I get name a mainline game that hasn't been amazing

39:05.820 --> 39:08.780
Well, as I'm saying you you ruined me and so now I'm like, right

39:09.500 --> 39:15.020
I've trained full ahead a bunch of comments on that video. We're like, oh this idiot this dumb luke guy

39:15.260 --> 39:20.940
He doesn't know about the fallout 76 that that sounds like me. It's not a main game brother

39:21.820 --> 39:24.940
non-canon if it was it would be called fallout five

39:26.700 --> 39:28.700
They just they skip too many numbers

39:29.020 --> 39:30.380
yeah

39:30.380 --> 39:36.060
Fallout shelter. Yeah, it has fallout is the first word. It's not a mainline game. It's a some mobile game

39:36.060 --> 39:41.100
I don't give a crap about that. Yeah, I did not care about other scrolls of blades or whatever it's called

39:41.100 --> 39:43.100
Yeah, because it's a mobile game. I don't care

39:45.260 --> 39:47.760
Just matter to me. It's relevant

39:49.740 --> 39:53.500
Oh, yeah, they made oblivion for Nokia phones. Yeah, it doesn't matter

39:54.060 --> 39:57.360
It wasn't one of their original games and like four people know that so shut up

40:07.980 --> 40:12.300
Any ETA on the iOS fix for chat, uh, I don't remember if this was part of it

40:12.300 --> 40:17.580
I think James in the chat so he might bark at me, but um, was that in the most recent there should be

40:18.380 --> 40:22.060
Maybe it hasn't propagated yet. There's an iOS update that went out like this week

40:22.460 --> 40:26.220
That you should be getting soon that that fixed a bunch of things. It might not fix chat. I don't know

40:36.060 --> 40:40.940
What's your feelings about having to work under a new ceo will it be more difficult now that you have to learn how to

40:41.900 --> 40:44.860
Manipulate to get to do things that you want to do

40:46.300 --> 40:50.300
Uh, you're deciding that to be very clear

40:50.780 --> 40:52.540
um

40:52.540 --> 40:58.460
So far all of my working that I've done with Taren has been positive to be completely honest. Um

40:59.820 --> 41:01.820
He's

41:03.100 --> 41:05.100
How do I word this?

41:05.420 --> 41:12.620
He has a lot of the personality traits that Linus has that I like

41:13.100 --> 41:19.100
He can be very blunt. He's very clear about what he wants. If you screw up, he'll call you on it all those types of things

41:19.100 --> 41:21.100
I'm not looking for

41:21.100 --> 41:23.100
Uh, a leader that's a pushover

41:23.820 --> 41:25.820
but

41:25.820 --> 41:29.980
His focus being being the CEO of the company instead of

41:30.780 --> 41:36.620
Instead of it with Linus where his focus is really making videos and then he's also the CEO, I guess

41:37.420 --> 41:38.380
Is helpful

41:38.380 --> 41:41.260
There's some stuff around the company that like needs a lot of work

41:41.660 --> 41:44.140
And it needs someone in that position to be able to do it

41:44.700 --> 41:50.940
And I've been honestly pretty frustrated for quite a while that I haven't been able to get things moving in that regard

41:51.180 --> 41:54.940
And it's just because Linus has had just way too much stuff on his plate

41:54.940 --> 42:00.220
Like it's not that Linus didn't want to didn't think there should be a solution here. I didn't want to work on it

42:00.380 --> 42:01.980
He just didn't have the time

42:01.980 --> 42:03.980
Um, so having Taren in position

42:04.620 --> 42:05.820
Is good

42:05.820 --> 42:08.460
There are already things that I've been talking to Taren about being like, hey

42:08.940 --> 42:12.220
Like this stuff has been kind of borked for a really long time

42:12.380 --> 42:18.220
We should work on this. These are the things that I feel strongly about in regards to this and he's been very receptive to those conversations

42:18.460 --> 42:20.460
So I think that's cool

42:20.940 --> 42:27.820
It's not about manipulating him if I have to manipulate him

42:28.540 --> 42:30.540
um

42:31.660 --> 42:37.100
I think sometimes that word gets thrown around too much convincing is not necessarily manipulating if I have to convince him

42:37.100 --> 42:39.740
That's fine. If I have to manipulate him, um

42:40.460 --> 42:42.460
Then I feel like the whole experiment failed

42:44.140 --> 42:46.460
Or I'm just doing a bad job one of the two

42:50.460 --> 42:52.460
You

43:13.180 --> 43:17.820
Oh, he revised his question by the time I got to it. I'm very scrolled up. I should just like skip to the bottom

43:18.380 --> 43:20.620
Uh, what are your feelings about having to work on a new ceo?

43:20.620 --> 43:23.580
Will it be more difficult now that you have to learn how to manipulate someone new?

43:24.140 --> 43:28.460
Other than linus to get to do things that you want to do retouch because the screw up. Oh, that's the same question

43:29.020 --> 43:31.020
Yeah, I don't know. Um

43:32.940 --> 43:36.380
I don't know. I think my last I think my last statement was good

43:36.780 --> 43:41.260
I'm now remembering now that you say that Linus and I talked about how we manipulate each other on the show

43:41.580 --> 43:43.500
And I realized

43:43.500 --> 43:45.100
It's just I don't know

43:45.100 --> 43:47.660
I think it's fine is ultimately what I'm trying to say

43:48.780 --> 43:50.780
Oh

43:53.420 --> 43:58.140
Here's Conrad's comments about final fantasy 16. It's so good. Just play it. Wait. So is it out already?

44:00.540 --> 44:02.540
By final fantasy 16

44:05.580 --> 44:07.580
Available now

44:07.580 --> 44:09.340
Okay

44:09.340 --> 44:13.340
Maybe that'll be something I do this weekend. Do I have any time this weekend at all?

44:13.820 --> 44:15.820
I

44:17.500 --> 44:21.020
Don't know my schedule is not really my own right now because of the

44:22.220 --> 44:27.740
Family stuff going on, but if I do maybe I'll I'll pick it up. What is that? Can I do I just buy on steam?

44:28.860 --> 44:30.860
By final

44:31.420 --> 44:33.420
Steam

44:43.020 --> 44:45.020
Is that a no

44:50.860 --> 44:53.100
So I'm gonna answer it eventually I'm just gonna keep scrolling chat

44:54.460 --> 44:56.460
as employees do you guys

44:56.780 --> 45:01.900
By your merch you have a discount a lot of money free stuff discount slash a lot of money free stuff is is is the

45:02.140 --> 45:06.380
Is the situation you guys okay with open source clients for float plane? What?

45:07.580 --> 45:09.580
I'll see you making one. Oh, yeah

45:09.980 --> 45:16.060
Anyone at ltt going to game con and calorie this weekend? I doubt it. Seriously doubt it

45:17.980 --> 45:23.180
Put through hours and rank in rocket league well right now. I'm unranked because I haven't played in forever, but I used to be a

45:24.060 --> 45:26.060
champion

45:26.060 --> 45:29.660
Champ whatever one. I don't remember three one. I don't know

45:30.060 --> 45:31.260
um

45:31.260 --> 45:35.580
Or grand champ or whatever the highest category before you get into like

45:36.300 --> 45:38.300
the professional stuff

45:39.020 --> 45:41.020
in

45:41.100 --> 45:43.100
snow day

45:43.180 --> 45:46.620
Because I'm canadian play the hockey version and it honestly it's so much better

45:47.260 --> 45:49.420
Use soccer ball players and get off your high horse

45:50.060 --> 45:53.580
Um, can og's get an og tag? Nah, probably not

45:54.540 --> 45:57.580
Um came here for the roast decided to stay hell. Yeah

45:59.580 --> 46:05.580
It's great that Bethesda just fully embraced modding their games and brought mods to the console versions of skyrim and fallout 4

46:05.740 --> 46:10.300
Starfield is most likely going to be the same and the amount of mods I will have and my game is going to be insane

46:10.700 --> 46:14.780
After I finish my first playthrough though. Yeah, I definitely want to do first playthrough with no mods

46:15.180 --> 46:20.460
Um, but they have already said that it's going to have lots of mod support. Um, so

46:21.420 --> 46:23.420
Yeah

46:23.980 --> 46:26.700
Conrad says just play it. He's talking about Final Fantasy 16

46:27.340 --> 46:31.660
Uh, I will I just need to find time and then he said starfield is going to be so good

46:31.740 --> 46:34.220
Even if it's bad, that's kind of how I feel about it right now

46:34.300 --> 46:38.540
And I'm not even lying because like I I have to think about it this way right like I

46:42.700 --> 46:47.180
A lot of people that I talked to think that the best Bethesda game

46:48.300 --> 46:51.020
Ever made was the first one that they played

46:51.820 --> 46:57.900
Like I I think it's Morrowind and the first game I played from Bethesda was Morrowind

46:58.460 --> 47:00.940
and the second one I played was Fallout 3 and

47:01.580 --> 47:03.580
Fallout 3 is my second favorite game they ever made

47:04.300 --> 47:06.300
And it tends to like go that way

47:06.300 --> 47:08.300
um

47:08.300 --> 47:13.660
And I suspect I might not find that starfield is like my favorite game of theirs

47:13.740 --> 47:17.340
I'm probably going to complain about the standard things that I complained about with Bethesda games

47:17.580 --> 47:20.460
They probably dumbed down a bunch of different types of systems

47:21.180 --> 47:24.140
They probably narrowed scope in a few different ways

47:24.700 --> 47:26.860
Made it more accessible did things like that

47:28.620 --> 47:36.540
And it doesn't matter because while I thought Fallout 4 was a pretty decent detraction from a lot of things in Fallout 3

47:36.780 --> 47:40.460
And while I thought Skyrim was a pretty decent detraction from things in Oblivion

47:40.460 --> 47:43.020
Which was already a pretty decent detraction from things in Morrowind

47:43.980 --> 47:48.060
Fallout 4 was still an amazing game and Skyrim was still an amazing game

47:48.060 --> 47:51.900
And I spent a bunch of time playing both of them and I would still be interested in playing modded versions today

47:52.460 --> 47:54.460
So who cares?

47:54.780 --> 47:58.140
I don't I'm excited. It's gonna be fantastic

47:58.780 --> 48:04.460
I mean, I still play modded skyrim occasionally. Yeah, and since there's still Skyrim videos today

48:04.620 --> 48:09.580
It's still good. Yes. The community is amazing. Yes, and from the first

48:10.140 --> 48:12.940
Announcement of starfield. I'm like, okay day one

48:13.580 --> 48:17.420
I'm gonna get onto the modding scene for this day one. I missed

48:18.060 --> 48:21.260
Skyrim. I missed Oblivion modding and all that sort of stuff

48:21.820 --> 48:27.740
So I want to be want to be in it. I want to be doing the learning. Oh doing the learning. You're gonna mod yourself. Yeah

48:29.260 --> 48:33.420
I'm that excited about starfield that I'm like, I want to be I want to be part of the community

48:35.900 --> 48:39.500
That's super sick because it's gonna be a Bethesda game

48:41.340 --> 48:47.180
And it'll have problems and it'll have things that can be approved upon or adjusted or modified you should make a bird hole

48:48.380 --> 48:50.380
It's gonna have birds in it space birds

48:51.500 --> 48:53.500
That's that that actually sounds like a really approachable

48:54.060 --> 48:58.540
Uh, like first mod is just like a bird for your spaceship

48:59.020 --> 49:03.020
That'd be sweet. Just a bird model or something like that. That'd be awesome. You know, uh

49:03.580 --> 49:05.580
Sound an animation something like that

49:05.580 --> 49:07.740
That'd be fun. That'd be fun. That's a good idea actually

49:08.300 --> 49:11.580
I still haven't made you your own bird. I keep forgetting

49:12.540 --> 49:16.460
They're eyeing data scientists not right now

49:19.580 --> 49:25.580
After see this this the these are the takes I don't get uh sultan of slack

49:26.380 --> 49:31.580
Said after how badly Bethesda treated Fallout 3 and Fallout 4

49:32.060 --> 49:34.060
I have very little hope for starfield

49:35.260 --> 49:37.260
What are these people talking about?

49:38.220 --> 49:41.980
I think it wasn't new vegas. Yeah

49:42.860 --> 49:44.860
And therefore bad

49:44.860 --> 49:49.820
But like come on guys. I know a lot of people that really like the fallout series, but

49:50.700 --> 49:55.420
I don't know if it's ever been for me really. I'd eh eh

49:56.860 --> 49:59.900
Games are just bad most of the time

50:02.380 --> 50:04.380
But they're bad because it's so subjective

50:04.460 --> 50:11.100
Fallout 4 was bad closer to far cry than Fallout not an rpg. Okay, so that's what I'm talking about. It's just a bad take though

50:11.900 --> 50:13.900
It's bad for them

50:14.300 --> 50:15.100
Sure

50:15.100 --> 50:17.100
Or for you, but it's still a good game

50:18.860 --> 50:20.860
For

50:22.300 --> 50:25.660
Fallout 4 is like many people's favorite game ever

50:27.820 --> 50:29.820
A metascore of 80s

50:29.820 --> 50:31.820
Like pretty good

50:33.420 --> 50:40.700
I had a bunch of fun. I I I can't expect every single game that they ever make especially when you're making story-driven

50:41.820 --> 50:47.420
Experience games. I can't expect everyone to be better than the previous one. Like if you're playing like madden

50:48.460 --> 50:54.220
Make sure I expect a 1 to 2 percent improvement over the previous game and almost no reason to buy the new one

50:54.220 --> 50:59.820
Other than roster changes. Sure. Cool. It got better

51:00.780 --> 51:03.740
I don't expect every game that Bethesda ever releases to be

51:04.460 --> 51:07.500
Objectively better than the previous one. I expect to have fun

51:08.620 --> 51:12.140
And I can pretty much guarantee I'm gonna have fun with starfield. I'm excited

51:12.940 --> 51:15.180
I wonder what people expect from fallout is

51:16.060 --> 51:21.740
Leaning much more heavily into the role-playing aspect of it because new vegas was very very good

51:22.700 --> 51:25.180
Because new vegas was very very heavy into the

51:25.980 --> 51:31.660
You're a person go do what your character would do. You're like reputation systems and stuff like that

51:31.740 --> 51:34.220
And I believe fallout 4 that's the newest run, right?

51:35.180 --> 51:36.620
It's your

51:36.620 --> 51:43.020
Apparent and go find your child and it's and it's more of a shoot them out and stuff like care about your kid instead of like

51:43.340 --> 51:46.060
Well, my fallout character wouldn't care about his kid

51:46.700 --> 51:50.220
And then you just don't get to play the game properly not as much

51:50.540 --> 51:54.540
Right, whereas, you know, there's there's obviously story lines, but they're not

51:55.260 --> 51:59.420
About your character your character falls into those story lines

51:59.420 --> 52:04.700
And there are other Bethesda games that work in very different ways. Exactly morrowind was extremely based around

52:05.580 --> 52:07.500
um

52:07.500 --> 52:10.700
Any direction you want to go you can technically beat the game in like three minutes

52:11.180 --> 52:13.340
um

52:13.340 --> 52:19.020
There's there's insane customizability when it comes to spells and stuff like that and a lot of people like that

52:19.260 --> 52:23.420
But they got a lot of feedback saying that the the spell casting

52:23.740 --> 52:28.380
If you if you try to be a caster in that game some major wizard or whatever you want to call it because the classes

52:28.380 --> 52:29.580
Were all made by yourself

52:29.580 --> 52:33.740
But if you tried to be that archetype in that game, it was really underpowered

52:33.740 --> 52:37.660
They were getting that feedback in reality by an insane amount

52:37.740 --> 52:39.900
It was the strongest tree to possibly go down

52:39.900 --> 52:46.860
But it was so difficult to get there that only some like hyper nerds got there including myself, which was great and it was fun

52:47.580 --> 52:49.020
but

52:49.020 --> 52:51.900
It wasn't accessible to a huge percentage of people

52:52.700 --> 52:54.700
So I liked morrowind more

52:55.980 --> 52:58.780
I don't know that morrowind is objectively a better game

52:58.940 --> 53:03.500
I think the average person would probably like oblivion more because it was a little bit more approachable

53:03.740 --> 53:07.980
Now that's a dangerous line to constantly go down because you end up with super mario brothers

53:08.700 --> 53:12.300
um, but like in a fantasy world, I don't know but like it's

53:13.100 --> 53:19.900
It doesn't mean it's bad. It just means it's different and what you want might be might not be exactly in line with that

53:20.220 --> 53:25.180
But that's okay. I don't think that Fallout 4 was my least favorite fallout that has ever released

53:26.540 --> 53:29.100
For sure. I still think it was a great game and had a lot of fun

53:35.340 --> 53:40.700
Do you think LMG will look to unionize since Linus isn't the CEO anymore? No Linus still owns the company my dude

53:43.260 --> 53:46.060
I can't believe you bought t-shirts me neither

53:47.900 --> 53:52.460
It was very weird actually, um, I only did it because I had to and I only bought solid color shirts

53:53.500 --> 53:58.140
I bought I think it was like five or six and they were just like, oh, I got a blue one a white one

53:58.780 --> 54:01.660
a gray one a black one a red one whatever

54:04.300 --> 54:08.140
Have you heard all the j-slat AI music? Yep, it sounds like AI music

54:13.020 --> 54:15.020
You

54:27.260 --> 54:29.260
I can try the demo before I dive in

54:29.500 --> 54:35.420
A fun fantasy 16 like at this point reading all the reviews and stuff. I think it's only ps5

54:38.380 --> 54:40.380
I don't have a ps5

54:42.460 --> 54:47.660
I don't want to buy a ps5. That's only for ps5. How fancy 16

54:48.220 --> 54:50.540
How fancy his 16 is hitting pc in

54:51.660 --> 54:53.660
2024

54:55.180 --> 54:57.660
Well, I guess it'll be a while that tracks

55:03.980 --> 55:09.340
Do you like the jrpg stuff they're just so deep and complicated and lengthy

55:10.300 --> 55:12.460
At least for me. I've enjoyed some

55:12.860 --> 55:14.060
Um

55:14.060 --> 55:18.620
Very controversially, which is not going to back up my statements about the starfield and Bethesda games

55:18.860 --> 55:20.860
But I liked Final Fantasy 8

55:21.100 --> 55:27.420
Um, a lot of people are like, oh this grew. Final Fantasy 7 is the biggest game. Um, I just never played Final Fantasy 7

55:29.660 --> 55:33.740
I I had eight I was a poor boy. I had eight because my best friend had eight

55:34.140 --> 55:36.940
It's the only reason I didn't have any of the other Final Fantasy games

55:37.260 --> 55:40.780
So I I mostly haven't played Final Fantasy games because I just like haven't had to them

55:40.860 --> 55:44.780
I never had a PlayStation. I was never really in the ecosystem to really have Final Fantasy games

55:45.020 --> 55:47.500
I played I played Final Fantasy 8 on a pc

55:48.220 --> 55:50.220
um

55:50.380 --> 55:53.580
So I don't know I've nothing against it. I've just never really been in the thing

56:07.740 --> 56:22.460
I'm trying to I'm trying to get through the chat a bit so I can catch up. I'm at like the top of the chat window

56:24.060 --> 56:30.220
Will you upgrade to a 4090 for starfield? I've honestly been I've been thinking about it. I don't like 4090s in particular

56:30.620 --> 56:31.740
um

56:31.740 --> 56:36.460
But I could look to upgrade my graphics card to something but I I just I don't know

56:37.340 --> 56:43.020
The whole like hey, I might melt your cables and do all this other kind of stuff when I have birds that are right next to my computer

56:43.100 --> 56:47.500
Like I'm not gonna risk anything melting. I don't know. I know it's a very small percentage chance

56:47.900 --> 56:49.900
But if plastic melts next to the birds

56:50.780 --> 56:55.500
And they get sick I will be enraged and I'm just not gonna chance it

57:01.980 --> 57:06.860
I like this take from conrad I feel like most games are really good

57:07.020 --> 57:10.300
And even the bad ones still have merit and can be enjoyed

57:11.180 --> 57:15.660
I think that's true in a lot of realms like linus and I have had a lot of fun lately

57:16.380 --> 57:18.380
Last time we played it. We played with his son

57:18.460 --> 57:20.780
um playing a game called slap shot rebound

57:21.340 --> 57:22.460
Is that game

57:22.460 --> 57:27.260
Objectively good on like any way you can measure games like probably no

57:28.060 --> 57:30.940
The graphics are trash. The controls are very difficult

57:31.500 --> 57:33.500
um

57:34.060 --> 57:36.060
The physics seem like okay

57:37.100 --> 57:42.060
There's some stupid stuff like where if you play online, there's cosmetics you can get where people are invisible

57:42.380 --> 57:47.980
Partially invisible other than they're like jersey like their head is invisible which makes them way harder to see and it's very annoying

57:49.260 --> 57:51.580
None of that matters. We're having a good time. Who cares?

57:53.260 --> 57:58.380
Now like I don't want everyone to necessarily think that way because I just don't want us all to be complacent and be happy with

57:58.540 --> 57:59.660
Trash games that come out

57:59.660 --> 58:07.020
But like I think people are really like the gaming community is really incredibly toxic and extremely negative about just like everything

58:07.580 --> 58:11.980
And uh, I think sometimes things get much too hard much too bad of a wrap

58:28.940 --> 58:30.940
You

58:44.380 --> 58:48.700
This is another take that I find very interesting when people talk about single player games

58:50.940 --> 58:53.820
Heavy chicken guy says power armor was cool and followed for

58:54.140 --> 58:58.300
It's kind of overpowered to the point where you could use it all the time if you get the perks right

58:58.620 --> 59:01.100
Okay, so if you think that's overpowered in a bad way

59:01.580 --> 59:02.620
don't

59:02.620 --> 59:03.900
do it

59:03.900 --> 59:08.860
Okay, now we're now we're talking about min maxing and optimizing the fun out of a video game

59:09.020 --> 59:11.660
And it's a single player game rpgs

59:12.940 --> 59:18.460
You have to limit your own fun. You have to decide what your fun is from a game dev perspective

59:18.460 --> 59:20.140
It can be very difficult

59:20.140 --> 59:23.260
if the avenues to optimize the fun out of the game are

59:23.820 --> 59:28.940
Very clear cut and obvious because players in general will always attempt to

59:29.820 --> 59:31.980
Easy way to fix that. Don't use power armor

59:33.180 --> 59:37.660
One of my favorite things to do in games is artificial limitations and like playing weird game modes and stuff

59:37.900 --> 59:41.020
I did I played a certain version of hitman. I don't remember what one it was

59:41.340 --> 59:46.220
It's been a long time, but I was streaming it and I had this whole series of streams that I called knife man

59:47.020 --> 59:50.140
Uh, and I played I played through the entire game just stabbing everything

59:51.020 --> 59:54.940
This sounds like uh, you know, I think it was it man. I don't remember what came was everybody in skyrim

59:54.940 --> 01:00:01.340
Always plays like the stealth archer, right? Yeah, so just don't my my archetype is uh, the character is always named punches and drugs

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.860
And he just punches things because what you can do high on scooma all the time

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.580
Punch and stuff. Yeah, because when you wear like really advanced like bracers

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:16.380
You can also highly level the smithing skill and then you can get super overpowered like

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:22.940
Bracers which give bonuses to unarmed attacks and so you just walk up to dragon all that out. Yeah, sweet. I love it

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:27.820
Yeah, that's super cool. Yeah, don't like don't there's this I don't know what happened

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:31.740
But in the last like 10 years everyone thinks they're gonna be an esports star

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:38.060
And just plays every multiplayer game as if their life depends on it because they're they get their living this way

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.020
Like I don't know what's going on, but it's absolutely a thing

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.300
And I feel like that's creeping into the single player space where everyone's like

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:49.660
I have to play everything on maximum difficulty and min max everything to be the best and it's like

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:53.580
Uh, you're playing a single player game. You should actually probably be aiming to have fun

01:00:53.980 --> 01:01:02.460
Uh, there's a lot of punch dragon. Yeah, like there's there's potentially cooler ways to do that other than just trying to be the absolute best at playing

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:07.740
Skyrim like that's such a weird thing to even have a goal for

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.300
um

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.500
If you do it sure cool, I don't know. It's not really my thing

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.460
You

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:30.220
What's your go-to bathroom game when sitting on the john uh chess puzzles

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.980
Google on basant hey, yeah

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.980
Yeah

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.580
PS5s are relatively easy to get this

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:49.180
Nowadays, yeah, and they still cost hundreds of dollars

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.100
I'm cheap conrad you forget I'm cheap

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:57.500
I can just wait for it to come to pc. I'm probably gonna do that

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:14.700
No get it now so I can talk to you about it and how and now I have to worry about spoiling things. Ah

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.780
That's a decent point

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.780
I wonder if I can like borrow one from work or something is that even so are you allowed to do that still?

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.020
You can do that used to be whatever you want

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.620
But we're trying to like cut back on it a little bit. I think yeah

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:42.460
You know, it's it's not are you so I'll say this way. Are you supposed to still do that?

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:48.220
Is that generally against the standards of the company holds

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.780
I think it's a case-by-case sort of thing. Okay, uh, if you want to like

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.580
Try something

01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:01.740
You know, it's uh, I don't know if it's set in stone right now. Don't quote me. This isn't live maybe

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.380
Hopefully

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.780
Oh aj says he'll loan me his

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.340
What are you being loaned?

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:15.660
Huh, what are you getting loaned aj is is saying that he'll loan me his playstation for a couple months

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.940
So he'll come back to bc sooner which?

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:26.140
Kind of works for me because I get a free temporary playstation and also I get to see aj more so like I'm kind of down with this hell. Yeah

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:32.220
14 is objectively the best Final Fantasy. So I think this is back again. I'm way up in the chat

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.220
I think this is when I said Final Fantasy 8

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:39.660
But that's my problem. I never played 14. I never played 14 never played 7 never played 6

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:44.940
Never played 3 never played like all these ones that people talk about all the time is being super great. It's like, okay

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:48.540
Yeah, that's cool. I liked 8. Why because I it's the one I played

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.340
I don't know

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.660
As far as I know I might like all of them

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.460
I have no idea

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.700
I think my first was uh

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:00.380
10

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.380
Which upsets a lot of people

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:07.660
Did that one suck or something apparently? I don't know. It's the one with the the water football

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.740
They do they always have these like weird mini games, don't they?

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:19.260
Final Fantasy 8 had this like really weird very difficult like card trading and battling game built into it

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:24.300
I don't remember what it's called, but it was it was wacky. Okay, people seem to think that 10 is good

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:27.580
You know, I don't know who's wrong anymore. I just uh

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.700
Are they opening cutscene with the ha ha ha?

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.460
Okay, I know what we're talking about that might that might be 10 it might be 12

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:41.340
I don't know people always rip on that but doesn't she tell him to laugh and then he's like forcing a laugh out

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:46.220
I think the context the context makes sense, but it's still bad. Yeah

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.220
I can't remember it might have been you or somebody else. I think it's similar to that

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:54.220
I take this chip and eat it kind of thing where you know the

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.060
Out of context it makes absolutely no sense. Yeah

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:02.380
Yeah, it was uh, it was deliberately fake, but if you take it out of context

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.180
It's hilarious

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:12.140
Fallout 3 is son looking for his father fall out for his father looking for his son. I'm sorry in my opinion

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.140
It's just not great

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:19.740
Okay, it's your opinion. So that's fine, but like who cares? I don't know

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:29.820
There is only one ending cutscene in both Fallout 3 and 4 unlike 1 2 and new vegas

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.460
The point of fallout is supposed to be it's heavily choice-based RPG

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.900
Where you see your actions affect the world but as it just doesn't do that

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:43.740
They don't care about the story or RPG elements. Ah, okay, so this is this is my take

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.700
Way better than 4 at least journey

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:51.420
Not the destination. Yeah, I know that the ending point can be kind of

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.900
You know, it's a nice little bow on the package

01:05:53.900 --> 01:06:00.220
But like people became really obsessed with ending cutscenes with mass effect. Yeah, this mass effect really

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:03.900
Screwed up with one of their ending cutscenes

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.380
I think a lot of that would be

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:13.020
Like I would feel a bit jilted. I guess with that as well. Uh, I know this was a big concern for

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.340
cyberpunk as well

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:20.780
Is you tout all of these like mechanics that your choices have consequences

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:26.460
And so somebody'll do a playthrough with one set of choices and one sort of character in mind, right?

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.980
People are now actually

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:32.220
Role playing the game to completion and they get to their ending and they're satisfied and they go, okay

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:36.060
Now for a second playthrough, I'm going to play this type of character and it all goes the same

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:41.660
And it's exactly the same and so it's like, well, why did I bother a lot of my people are super invested?

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:47.820
They're now getting shafted the way that I like to talk about is like with with morrowind my favorite game of all time

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.300
I had been playing that game

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:56.140
Okay, for context when I was a kid I played multiple sports at a very high level. I wasn't

01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:01.580
Playing games all the time. Sometimes when they hear this they're like, oh my god, you must have had like many hundreds of hours

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:07.260
I'm like, no, not really. Um, but I had been playing morrowind for like at least a couple months before

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:10.060
Uh, my dad and I decided to buy a players guy

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:13.180
It's the only game we've ever bought a bought a players guide for but we were like, this is fun

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.340
But we feel like we're missing out on a lot

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:19.420
Uh, and we bought a players guide and the first thing I realized when we opened the players guide was like, holy

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.180
There's a main quest

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:28.300
What are you talking about? There's a main quest because in morrowind when you first create your character

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:32.380
They give you this like package and you're supposed to deliver it to someone and every single time

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.780
I would start my character and then I would just sell

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:38.700
I would be rapidly selling things that are in my inventory because I'd steal a bunch of stuff because why not

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:43.340
And then I go to the store and I go to sell it all and I would just be spamming selling everything

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:48.220
And I would sell the package by accident and there's no quest log in morrowind

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:51.020
It's just a journal that you write in

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.180
so if you just like

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.740
Don't go all the way back to the beginning of the journal and it says

01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:59.580
I have this package i'm supposed to give to somebody in bel mora

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.500
You might just never do it

01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:05.900
And I never did

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:09.820
So I never once I had a bunch of different characters. They were all built in different ways

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:15.580
One of them was like really focused on fighting with a sword and board and I started off with him in the fighter's guild

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.300
And then I went to house talani and did all this other kind of stuff

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.140
I didn't think there was a main quest

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:26.780
I thought it was just like you exist in this world and you just do things you become the grandmaster of various

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:30.620
Guilds and houses and whatnot and all that kind of stuff and it's cool and I really enjoyed it

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:35.180
And then I figured out there was a main quest and it was neat and it was not the best part of the game at all

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:41.740
I don't think the main people meme about not doing the main quest and Bethesda games all the time

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:45.580
And they there's it's literally come up in starfield interviews a bunch

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:50.940
Whether like are you prepared for players to never care about your main quest and they're like, yeah, we are

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:56.060
That's what it's about because they don't care about that final ending cinematic because it's unimportant

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.140
And it's also not the end of the game

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:01.900
Because the whole game is based around like dan was just saying it's the journey

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:06.140
It's the experiences it's the things that you do among it your choices are going to matter

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.340
Or at least they did in every previous Bethesda game

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:12.700
Based on how you deal with things along the way

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:19.020
But not necessarily in the end. I don't care about some stupid cinematic at the end personally again

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:24.220
In your opinion if you hate that that's fine. You just don't have to like Bethesda games. I don't think that means it's a bad game

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.700
I think that means you don't like it

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:29.740
So it might be a bad game for you. Maybe you shouldn't buy starfield

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:33.260
It doesn't mean that this is going to be a bad game for other people though

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.340
I don't think I've ever beaten Skyrim

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:39.900
Yeah, and who cares?

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:43.660
There's so much that I've never seen. Have you done?

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.460
Have you met Xeograth in the bar?

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.380
I have no idea

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.380
That's a lot of bars

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:56.540
Yeah, that's like the best part of the game in my opinion. Maybe maybe

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.980
I have a lot of playthroughs. Yeah

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.220
Lot of scooma

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:12.060
Do you know are all your runs like drug runs?

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:19.100
Yeah, because it gives you bonus points to speed and attack speed. So it's like integral for the entire build

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:24.540
To like yeah, I don't know. It's great. That's funny. I suggest everybody try at least ones

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:32.220
Look at how many people played Dark Souls naked for zero actual achievements. Yeah, and that is awesome. That is so sick

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:36.140
That is so cool. I get so jazzed up over that kind of stuff

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:40.780
I love I love finding like oh, there's some shooter game and I figure out. Oh, there's a crossbow

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:43.820
I'm like, oh, okay. I'm gonna do a non ballistic run

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.060
I'll only use like melee weapons and crossbows and like I'll pretend I'm in like

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:53.420
The medieval times and everybody else has I came through time. I don't know how to operate a firearm or something

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.540
I don't know

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.060
Like I love

01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:02.140
Love doing these like weird artificial limitations. It makes it so much more fun for me. I used to play civilization

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:06.860
Before they had this as a thing. I think it was I played civilization

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.500
for

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:14.380
This why this way. Yeah, I played Civ 4 refusing to make a second city ever

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:18.860
I would do my own one city challenges before one city challenges in the game

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:22.140
I don't remember which Civ version this is but I'd do my own one city challenge

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:26.140
And then in I think it was Civ 5 they came out with venice

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:33.180
Which can't even build a second city and the whole idea is trying to navigate playing civilization with one city

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.420
I used to find that to be so much fun

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.220
It's so interesting. It was a lot more fun

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.980
Uh to me to do that than to crank the difficulty in Civ

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:45.020
Which just like allows the ai to cheat and gives you worse deals

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:49.340
And worse like r and g. It's like, okay, that's that's not that interesting to me

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:57.580
What is interesting me is navigating all of the complications that are involved with not being able to have a second city in a game around building cities

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.380
Like that. I don't know. That's what I'm super into

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.220
Yeah, I mean

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:08.940
There's a bunch of different approaches that you can take into games. I think you can look at them as

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.100
systems and like

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.540
Excel spreadsheets

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:17.980
That's certainly one way to approach it. Oh, I hear Linus. Yeah, Linus is coming. We're gonna have to stop talking about games. Sorry boys

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.340
Goodbye

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.340
And girls and everybody else

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.500
Okay, we've been pre-showing for

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.780
One hour 15 minutes. Yeah

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:37.980
You've been pre-show over an hour. Well, uh, you were on set for a video and mr. One take wonder over here

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:42.060
Usually is done pretty darn. It wasn't a scripted video. Well, I didn't know that

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:46.780
So here we are. It's fine. We've just been talking about games and stuff

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:51.500
Would you move? I see move your double onto the floor, please unless you want to keep them there all day

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.700
Okay, so

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:07.020
There's some interesting stuff. Yeah, we need you can have to leave because it's seven. Yeah

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.380
Also

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:13.340
I apparently need to review a script at the airport

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:18.700
Yes, that's right. No rest for the wicked. Is this are you going on vacation time?

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:26.620
What is vacation? Yeah, sir. Yeah, I understand but like is it supposed to be vacation? Yeah, okay, cool

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.860
At least there's that

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:32.300
Because I heard of von was going and I was like, oh, so it's like he's actually

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.740
Maybe doing something for himself. Maybe

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:40.140
Is it not still it's not still isn't it? I mean

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:47.180
I think you know that my version of

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.300
It means you're not where you're going

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:56.140
At home in my pajamas. Yeah, ideally not even pajamas

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:01.660
At home birthday suit. Yeah. Yeah doing nothing. Yeah

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.820
That doesn't happen very often. Yeah fair enough, but um

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:14.220
You know what I am overdue to whisk my wife away somewhere for some r and r so

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.900
That's good, too. If that's what baby wants, that's what baby gets

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:23.260
Once every 10 years

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.940
Spoiling her I know right

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:36.860
You gotta be careful or I might over overdo it here, but dad if you if you make mods

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:44.220
I will play any one of them. Um, that's sweet. I appreciate that. Yes, sir. Hopefully I can uh, I can get that together

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:52.140
If you make my birds in the game, I will freak out in a positive way

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:57.980
I just really need this food and then I do whatever I would probably say that's uh, that's feasible

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.780
I'm excited to have a wancho for an hour

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.660
When you need to leave

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.900
Okay 30

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:08.940
No, I could go at like nine

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:15.420
As long as you guys can lock up I could probably do as late as like 9 45 without actually missing my flight

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.580
Can you do the lights?

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:22.460
Yeah, yeah, I can I can lock up by myself if necessary. Oh no, I can always like leave

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:27.820
I can help. I just there's lots of lights in this building that if they do happen to be left on

01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.260
I'm gonna be so lost or we have no idea how to turn them off. Yeah, some of them are also

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:36.780
Automated so you can like never find the light switch. Okay. It's 41 minutes to the airport

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:39.980
You have to be there for I got my tycan back

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:42.780
so

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:48.860
I'm kidding. I'm kidding 20 minutes if it has a full charge. What was that noise? That is the uh, ac

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.060
A condensation pump. Oh my goodness

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:57.420
That thing uh, sounds a little worse for wear. Um, okay

01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.820
So

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:08.380
Okay, so you're so 9 15 so we got I could go at 9 30 so we got two and a half hours. Yeah

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.060
I got nexus

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.780
That's fun and a sweet car

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.340
Don't worry about it

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:20.460
No, I can't speed in that car. You've seen the rap, right?

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.420
I'm not getting off with a warning

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:25.980
Ha

01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:30.220
Very true. I can uh, I can target for two hours if that works

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.020
Oh, I think we just said two and a half

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:38.380
I'll target for two and then it'll go half over or oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, that's probably a decent idea

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.380
No, it won't go over

01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.140
Wait that just broke that break lovely

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.060
That just broke

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:57.340
Um, it actually broke that's fine. We could just do this

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.660
Look who my who my

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:09.020
I like this though. We actually had a spare. That's so uncommon that that happens. That's good for this. Yeah, but

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:18.380
Uh-oh, no, if he's got a spare that too, then we're good

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:29.100
Take this back. Okay, never mind. I didn't do anything wrong. I mean Linus Linus yourself. It's your fault. Anyways

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:38.620
Hmm, okay, I managed to get the threaded thing out. So that's good probably

01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:45.340
Um, I think this whole thing

01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:50.540
This looks like aluminum that's really stupid

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:54.380
A load bearing

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:57.340
What the

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:03.120
That is not the solution I expected

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:12.620
Hey

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:17.340
Why do we just have extra re20s?

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.380
Uh, there used to be

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:25.260
A podcast. Oh, yeah, there used to be four here. Oh, yeah that podcast that we spent more on like

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.980
The set for than ever made

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:34.940
There you go, you want to get this like set up how you want it. I'm afraid to touch it. No, this one's sturdy

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:44.700
Okay, well um

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.220
Yeah

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:56.700
Hmm that seems like it's getting tight at a very unfortunate angle which you know happens. No, no, I got this

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:02.140
You guys heard that it's okay, not to me

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.540
Okay, um

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:12.140
Cool

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:16.460
Let's uh go ahead and start the show then shall we?

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:23.740
Yeah, no I have to log into google again. Nice

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:33.340
Fortunately I have memorized my new password that I just changed it to because I have to log into google a f***ing lot

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.900
Because it signs me out a lot

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:41.900
Very annoying

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:45.340
Uh, am I the one who needs to resume the selected or are you already in the dashboard?

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:52.300
You have the dashboard open and logged in and the selected is I do paused. I do. Yep. What do you mean?

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:55.420
I do. I did it for you. So oh, there it is. Yep neat

01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:03.420
All right, we're doing this thing. Oh man, I can't see a damn thing with this mic. I enjoy that it got so much worse

01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:09.500
It was already bad and now it's just like this wall

01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.740
It looks crazy

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:22.300
You could be that guy just take mine, but it will like take a while. No, no, no, we gotta get started. Okay. All right. Let's do this thing

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:26.940
I like I can see like 40 percent of my screen

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.380
I don't even care

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:33.020
You could make the angle

01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:37.180
No, that probably won't help. I've resumed the selected the selected is resumed. All right

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.980
It's game over man game over. All right

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.060
Oh my god, I didn't open the dock

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:03.500
What is up and welcome to the WAN show everyone we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:09.900
Amazon has allegedly retaliated against critical news coverage

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:14.940
Also del australia was found guilty of deceptive pricing. You know

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.540
The company that we covered in secret shopper

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:22.620
They kept trying to push extended warranties down our throats

01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:25.020
And onsite service

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.260
Would they do that? We should hire people from there

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:32.700
I mean if I was trying to sell extended warranties and financing. Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good idea

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:37.900
What else we got this week pc building simulator features linus tech tips in an update

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:43.900
Oh, yeah, that's right. I saw that I don't nobody tells me anything these days

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.100
Do you know how I found out about that? No in a tweet

01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:49.900
From the linus tech account

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:55.500
Which I follow it actually looks awesome. It looks amazing. It looks very cool. It looks so good

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:58.460
I honestly never did it because I was like I've built enough computers

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:03.340
I don't need to simulate building computers, but I might just like check this out. It's kind of a fun game

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:09.100
Yeah, like we played it for our sponsored stream for epic games store way back when pc building simulator 2 came out

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:12.220
We should we should hold on. Sorry. We got to finish the intro. We should 1v1

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:17.500
What that's like a thing that you can do. I mean or just like yeah, you could both start at the exact same time

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:22.460
And see who can make more money. I'll make more money. Yeah, I lost to jake though, and I'm real salty about it

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:26.540
Oh, so you just want to beat me up. Oh, yeah for ego reasons. All right, good enough

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:34.300
Um, also the what else should we talk about? I don't know elan muskin zuckerberg might actually fight each other in a cage match

01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:38.060
That is not happening. Yeah, I said the same thing, but either way intro time

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:40.060
I

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:03.660
The show is brought to you by jump cloud kudos and zoho one

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.980
Ha ha ha

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:09.260
Jumping right into our headline topic

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:16.780
LTT is in pc building simulator. Yeah, and it's so cool. This looks so cool

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:21.020
All right, we did a video about pc building simulator a while back

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:28.780
Jake and I 1v1 to see who could make the most money and I think we gave ourselves an hour or something like that

01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:31.340
Basically just playing through the tutorial

01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:37.020
It's really cool because the amount of depth that they've built into this game

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:42.780
Is incredible like it really matters that you pick exactly the right compatible components

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:47.420
And a lot of it is not just building a computer like have you ever played it at all luke? No never

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:50.700
Oh, yeah, so you don't just build a computer for lulls

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:56.140
You run a pc shop where you repair computers and troubleshoot them

01:23:56.940 --> 01:24:01.420
And also build computers and then you build up an inventory of

01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:07.660
Parts from your repairs like oh this still had a good gpu and the customer said they didn't want it

01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:11.260
And then you can start to use them and other repairs and try to

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:16.060
You know optimize min max your your your your revenue and all that kind of stuff

01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:21.580
Toward the end of the tutorial you get to the point where you can actually run. Wait, what was that?

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:26.700
Was that in the game? Yes, you can run 3d mark in game and it will give you pretty realistic scores

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:33.420
Configure a fan control curves. It's incredibly deep and then toward the end. This is our final builds that we did

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.900
You can renovate. Yeah, you can renovate your no, I think this is from height

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:39.180
Oh, okay

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:45.020
You can renovate your storefront and like start to rebuild it and like I didn't get any further than that because I

01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:47.340
Rarely find time to play video games

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:49.660
but but but the point is

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:55.500
Pretty cool game and if you wanted to live linus's alternative reality life where you didn't start a youtube channel

01:24:55.580 --> 01:25:03.900
You could play pc billing simulator. We are freaking in it. Yeah, so here is their teaser trailer showing the

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:09.580
There's the pink server. Okay, man. We're gonna cat. We gotta freaking slow down. Yeah, there's too many references

01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:13.420
Just a second here. Okay, we're going point two five speed here. We're going. Oh

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:17.740
Point two five is not great. Okay. Okay. There's the pink server rec

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:23.020
This is the same flooring that we have in the pc build corner. Yeah, uh, there's one of our

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:28.940
Uh, I forget what we call this design, but this is one of our desk pad designs in orange. Yeah

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:34.620
Uh, what else we got here? I think that's also it in in black. It's hard to see but I think the pattern is there

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.940
I'm not sure. I'm not sure you might be right

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:40.860
Love that server rec freaking awesome

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.100
Um

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:47.660
Oh, I love that there's like studio lights and stuff a bunch of yeah, the studio lights are one thing

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:50.300
There's a bunch of set walls here tech linked set

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:56.940
Um, this is the one man. What is this one from? Obviously? I've seen it a thousand times

01:25:57.020 --> 01:26:03.180
Why can't I remember where this is from audience help me? Is that somewhere in the help me living room kitchen set? Yes

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:07.580
Yes, yes, it is and we've got the records on the walls just like in the living room set

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:09.900
That's the door. This is the door from the living room set

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.860
This is so cool

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.380
Oh, man. Look at this the little details

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.180
We totally use these little

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:27.180
Um extension cord spools aka arlo's cat pc building cafe. I love it amazing. Oh, man

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:31.500
Oh, man. Oh, I got the white. Uh got the white brick wall thing

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:37.020
We had something like that at some point actually even the fake plants look familiar. Oh my goodness. Well, yeah

01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:42.220
Hey, these things from the back of the pc build corner. They got the lighting in there and everything

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:49.100
Is that an ltt backpack? I think so. Is that an ltt backpack? I think so. No, they have the cable spool the extension cable spool

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:50.940
We have those for sure

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.660
That is definitely an ltt backpack sir

01:26:54.620 --> 01:27:01.180
That is incredible. Okay. Now. Hold on a second. Please. Tell me they have the screwdriver. All I've seen is the tweet so far

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.300
Wait, that's our desk

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:10.300
That's the desk. Oh, that totally is. This is the desk. We built the it's the like the cleanest setup desk or whatever

01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:11.900
They have those light thingies

01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:15.580
Whatever those are called. They don't remember leafs nano leafs or something. Okay, the right of the desk

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.700
That's not ours. Obviously. Oh the the

01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:22.860
Kid was yeah, yeah, and they've got there's a water bottle

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:26.860
They got the water bottle. Nice. There's three of them. They've got our ltt set deck

01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:32.220
We also have this shelf somewhere. I forget where it is, but we have it somewhere more water bottles

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:38.540
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is so cool the number. Oh, look, there's a there's a lioness face. Hold on. Wait, where right next to your mouse. Oh my god

01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:44.940
Okay, well that probably wasn't necessary, but it's in there. It's in there

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:53.820
Man they even like modeled the cap correct

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:58.860
Okay, we must have done a lot of work on this too because this is

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:05.740
Exactly right like that is that is high fidelity exactly the graphics that we are using on our water bottles

01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:10.380
The damaged blue back wall with the red there reminds me of the garage northern lights mouse pad

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.380
Yeah, this is so cool

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:19.180
I'm freaking out a little bit here. Apparently doughnuts in forza too

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:25.740
So like doughnuts in forza youtubers are just in video games now. Is this a thing? It was actually very cool. Oh, that's super cool

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.900
Yeah, it was awesome

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.780
Oh, this is so ridiculous. Wow

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.500
Speaking of accurate renders

01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:41.660
That is

01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:44.540
Oh, they have the new poles wallity. They have the new poles

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:46.300
Wait

01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:48.860
No, they do they have the fixed. Whoa

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:52.380
They have the fixed titanium carabiner poles

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:57.020
Okay, we're still working on getting those through mass production and getting them shipped out to people

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.460
I am loving this so much

01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:05.740
This is wild. Those I don't feel like they would stand out. Okay. It's a gold monitor. Ha ha

01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.420
Got them

01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:13.100
Oh

01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.460
So it's a whole theme for the back of your shop, I guess then yeah

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:19.260
Oh, I love it

01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:22.300
Oh my god, they even put a segue in the video description

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.140
I love it

01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:30.780
Okay, hold on a second. What am I? This isn't the trailer performing poorly. We just still have it on point two five. Yeah

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:38.780
That is so cool. I um that is wicked. I am super into it. That's awesome

01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:43.820
Uh, the update went live earlier this week. The update is free

01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:47.900
And you can try out the game's demo for free at lmg.gg

01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.540
Slash pc build sim 2

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:54.460
Uh, we're going to have that linked down below and if we don't have it linked down below dan is going to make sure

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:57.420
We have it linked down below. Thanks dan. Thanks dan

01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:02.300
That's so cool. They're oh man, there are some things I missed too

01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:07.900
Yeah build corner set inspired walls and logo lambo desk library

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:12.060
I didn't see that but apparently you can get like a picture of the the the lambo

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.700
Yeah, there it is

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:20.460
Oh, are these just like stickers and stuff? Yep. These are just decals that you can apply. So those are based on our sticker packs

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:23.100
Hey, they don't want you one. Let's go. Oh my god. Hey

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:25.740
Okay, well, that's enough of that

01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:33.580
Another big news this week amazon. Oh, you know what do we go straight for the bezos musk cage fight?

01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:37.180
Sure, it's not bezos and musk though. Oh, sorry not bezos

01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:43.980
Zuckerberg and musk yeah, so can I be the first to say that if this actually goes forward musk is going to get his

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.940
Absolutely

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:54.940
Oh my goodness zuckerberg seems to actually take personal fitness and like very serious fighting training kind of serious

01:30:55.100 --> 01:31:01.660
Yeah, and the thing about you know a billionaires. He might have had kind of a potato figure at some point

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:08.620
But I guess he can afford the best consultants and trainers because he's like kind of looking pretty good lately. Oh, yeah

01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:10.380
Oh, yeah

01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:15.820
Oh, yeah, apparently he recently did the mirf challenge. I had heard about a lot of his like jiu-jitsu stuff and stuff like that

01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:19.100
I had not heard about this apparently he completed the mirf challenge

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:24.060
Which is running a mile followed up by 100 pull-ups. It says 200 press ups

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:26.060
Okay

01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.060
I are they just saying push up

01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:31.900
Oh press up one sec. I don't know what a press up is

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.540
press ups

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:38.460
People are saying bezos kind of jacked too. Actually. Yeah. Yeah, I've noticed that

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:43.660
Yeah, this looks like a push-up. Okay. Um, it might be like a specific hand position or something

01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:52.140
But yeah 200 press ups 300 squats and then running another mile all while wearing a 20 pound weighted backpack

01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:55.820
That's stupid. That's really hard

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:03.100
I'm certain these things aren't like I'm certain he didn't do 100 pull-ups without having a break

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:10.620
Okay, but like this is amazing. They've actually got a fighter stats thing in the dock for us today

01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:16.700
And this is kind of incredible. So elons definitely got the height and weight advantage

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:22.620
He's a 511 180 plus pounds the zuck meanwhile. It's like my height

01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:25.740
I did not know that I I thought he was

01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:34.220
A normal height person. No, I had heard he's short. Okay only 150 pounds like I have 20 pounds on him

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:39.180
And like I'm not I'm not huge or anything. He's a skinny little chicken small dude

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:44.140
Musk definitely has an age disadvantage at 51 years old instead of

01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:50.460
39 for the zuck. I love the training regime here though

01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:53.420
Lifts weights sometimes

01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:57.340
And then we've got the mirf challenge here. And then this is the best

01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:01.740
Diet quote. I'd rather eat tasty food and live a shorter life

01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:06.700
This year. I've basically become a vegetarian since the only meat I'm eating is from animals

01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:09.900
I've killed myself which is like the chattest statement you could ever say

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:14.060
Apparently he did that mirf challenge in 40 minutes. That's

01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:16.780
Stupid that's crazy

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.500
That's actually wild

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:22.460
Geez

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.860
Elon might get actually killed

01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:31.980
In a cage with him. No, I'm not even I'm not even though

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:35.900
I mean if there was no end to it like yeah, yeah

01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:39.660
Well, no, I mean, yeah, I just I just mean like I I just

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:43.340
You're a potato right

01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:49.100
And then you're up against mirf challenge guy. Yeah, like it doesn't matter. It honestly. Yes. There are absolutely

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.540
Big advantages to being a lot heavier and a lot taller

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:56.940
Yeah, but like but these are not similar people

01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:59.740
physically like

01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:02.300
It doesn't matter mark will destroy him

01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:09.180
And to be clear, I am no mark zuckerberg fan neither of us are okay like

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:13.740
It's good facebook never mind him personally facebook has contributed

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:20.380
Basically negligibly to our success as an online media business like I don't even have

01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:25.660
I don't even have any kind of professional indebtedness to the facebook platform

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:32.540
Like actually if facebook had never existed that would be totally fine for me and meta to

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:37.980
Yeah, because we'd still have like oculus. Yeah, it might even be better. Yeah

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:39.980
um

01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:44.700
A meta spokesperson confirmed that zuckerberg was entirely

01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:50.780
Serious when he replied via his instagram story. Yeah, he's gone to like jujitsu tournaments and stuff

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:55.020
Zuckerberg would have no issue doing this musk replied

01:34:55.660 --> 01:35:01.100
Vegas octagon. I have this great move. I call the walrus where I just lie on top of my opponent and do nothing

01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:07.740
He will not get an opportunity to do that. I I can't I don't think he realizes like I can't tell with him

01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:14.220
A lot of people that have never been in an I don't know. Maybe he has someone's going to bring up some weird thing from his past

01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:20.060
Oh, yeah, he's claimed like he you know south africa, you know fought and stuff bullies and stuff. You sure

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:23.260
This is going to be a different reality

01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:33.340
As far as my understanding goes zuckerberg is actually very good and very serious when it comes to jujitsu and he will choke the absolute

01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.460
out of musk

01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:40.220
Dana white meanwhile has expressed interest in hosting the match

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:44.140
So, um

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:46.140
Of course he did

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:50.540
I mean, of course he did just a bunch free money. Oh my float plane chat is so funny

01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:53.180
musk is friends with joe rogan though

01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:59.980
They're kidding luke. They're kidding. They're kidding. Okay. Okay. It's amazing

01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:05.580
Uh, andrew tate said something about training musk. Yeah, what from a romanian prison like

01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:09.180
Via zoom

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:15.740
That is a thing some people do. Uh, yeah, it's not as good, but um, I think yeah, I don't know. I don't know

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:19.500
Say a bunch people are bringing up the send me location meme. That's pretty great

01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:22.620
Send me location

01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:24.700
Okay

01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:26.940
I will say though

01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.580
Okay, we're about to get really personal here

01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:31.980
You're six one six two

01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:37.340
If you round up, I'm six three. I'm like six two and like

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:43.100
You're over six feet. You don't get to round up. Sure. Okay. So you're six two. Then I'm past point. So you're six two

01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:49.500
I'm past point six two. So I'm six three. So you're six two. Okay. No, if you're about six you round down past a half

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:53.500
No, you round down when you're over six feet past a half doesn't matter

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:57.980
Doesn't make any sense. You round up when you're under the government says i'm six three

01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:03.660
The canadian government doesn't even use feet and inches. Yeah, they use centimeters. So get

01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:09.180
Remember quickly it's like 192 or something. I don't know whatever the point is

01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:11.100
um

01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:14.220
I'm just like i'm trying to i'm trying to kind of i'm kind of trying to

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:19.020
Think about you know for me. Okay, so i'm five seven

01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:22.060
five six and a half

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.020
Ah

01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:34.140
You have quite a few more inches on me than than musk has on zucker height or yeah in height. Okay. Well probably

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:39.740
But I didn't I didn't go to the uh to the nude bath in japan. So we'll never know for sure

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:46.140
The point is that you've got at least like oh man. So what's musk five eleven?

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:53.420
Yeah, so you've got like another three inches on me over what musk has on zuckerberg and i'm trying to think

01:37:54.380 --> 01:38:01.340
When you were full potato. What did you weigh at that point? I don't even want to say there's a lot though. Okay. Yeah like

01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:03.820
over 200

01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:10.700
I don't have no context for this. I haven't been under 200 since I was like 17. Okay. Well, okay over 250

01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:13.260
Yeah, oh, okay. All right. Yeah

01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:15.900
Man, so i'm just trying to think

01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:19.260
How fast how much do you think I weigh right now?

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:26.140
I look I have no context for this. I have always been under six feet. Yeah, I don't know how much bone weighs

01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:28.220
But just like fire out a number. Uh

01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:31.740
Right now. Yeah, I don't know 230

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.620
No

01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:41.580
But like not that close. It's definitely more than that. Okay. I weigh pretty much 250 right now right now. Oh

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:43.900
Yeah, oh

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:49.420
Yeah, now one thing to consider is I've put on a lot of muscle since then right and that weighs a lot more

01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:51.980
But I was more for sure

01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:58.300
Got it. Okay. So i'm 170. So their weight difference is actually a bunch of people are like what? Yeah. Yeah

01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:01.580
Yeah, and I there's no like this is flat like i'm doing okay

01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:06.540
Yeah, their weight difference is actually way smaller because I was thinking about it going like

01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:09.260
Even when you were out of shape

01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:15.260
Like I wouldn't go out of my way to go into an octagon with you. Like if I got lucky

01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:19.900
I could maybe try to like break something. Yeah

01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:26.300
Um before you kill me rather certain. I still would have won. Yes, but that but that is that is the the

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:33.500
The drasticness of that situation is significantly higher. Yeah, because you you had what like 100 pounds on me

01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:37.260
Yeah, we're talking 30 pounds difference

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:39.820
Yeah, which is a lot when it comes to these types of things

01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:44.540
But the gap in training between these people right? Well, the other thing too is zuckerberg

01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:51.500
Why zuckerberg would know that musk is gonna gas that too. He's got to carry an extra 30 pounds around with him

01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:57.020
And he's not trained. Here's a hot take. I don't think it would matter. I think mark could just take them

01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:00.460
Just go straight in. Yeah. I don't think I'm mad at all

01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:02.780
Just like

01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:09.740
The training gap here is insane the like physical capability gap here is insane

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:12.700
Like it's not even it's not even sort of close. I don't know

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:21.020
No, we are not speaking in kilos. We are canadians. Um, so we have absolutely no rhyme or reason to the units we use

01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:23.660
Uh, there's a flow chart. Um

01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:29.900
Yeah, there's like every all the canadiens talk about things in this with the same metrics. Yeah, but

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:34.140
I don't know. Uh, here it is. How to measure things like a canadian

01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:36.220
What are you measuring?

01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:41.100
Speed metric yeah distance. Is it your height? Yes, imperial

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:44.220
Is it your height? No, is it a long distance?

01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:49.340
Yes metric no, is it related to work?

01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:53.020
No metric. Yes, imperial

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:59.340
Okay, hold on. This is actually true. I am actually not kidding so far. It's temperature. Is it for cooking?

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.820
Yes, Fahrenheit. Yep

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:03.980
No, is it the pool's temperature?

01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:07.180
Yes, Fahrenheit. No, Celsius

01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:16.940
Mass, is it your weight? Yes pounds. No, is it very happy? Yes

01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:24.860
Volume is it for cooking? Yes cups and spoons. No

01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:27.740
metric

01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:30.220
That is so amazing. We are actually

01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:39.260
Right up. We have no idea what's going on. That's amazing. It comes from being neighbors and one thing that's not included here

01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:46.780
What are you measuring? Um, is it like an object? Um, because we always use imperial for construction because

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:51.100
We both use and export a lot of lumber to America

01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:56.540
So all of our all of our lumber like I was blown away when I heard that you could buy lumber that was a

01:41:57.420 --> 01:42:01.420
Three centimeter by six centimeter or whatever the hell a two by four is in metric

01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:05.980
And that's what they build with in europe and I got screwed over

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:12.700
Because whatever they use for drywall in uh in europe is like a slightly different thickness than here

01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:18.940
So the cool um acoustically isolating screws that I tried to use in my theater room that were from a european supplier

01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:23.660
Were ever so slightly I think not long enough or something and couldn't go through the imperial drywall

01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:27.340
Anyway, the point is our construction is also in imperial

01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:32.220
Um, so I would never use centimeters to describe anything in terms of

01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:37.820
sawing or cutting or screwing or hammering anything inches and feet all inches and feet

01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:43.180
But then you ask me to think about anything farther than about

01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:45.900
Oh

01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:52.620
No, because lots of other trades use feet too. So I would never be able to estimate uh like painting a house

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:54.700
I did all of that in imperial

01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:57.820
I'm pretty sure even when we ran the cable it was feet wasn't it?

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.740
Yeah

01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:05.340
I know cables in both though. I'll use them interchangeably. Yeah, me too

01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:08.700
Um, so this is why a lot of the time in our videos

01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:14.460
We will give a measurement in metric or we'll give one in imperial and we will completely forget

01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:19.660
It'll be inconsistent. Well, yeah, it there'll be it'll seem like there's no rhyme or reason to it whatsoever

01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:20.940
and

01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:28.940
All the way from the writer to the editor to the person who's like Q seeing the video all the way to publication

01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:34.460
Nobody will even think to include a conversion because for all of us. How many feet in a meter? I don't know

01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:36.220
what

01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:41.180
I know like mentally about how much it is. I don't know if it's off my head because everything I do that actually matters for it

01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:42.540
I do it in feet three

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:48.620
Okay, is it exactly? Yeah, see he doesn't know either come off it. I knew it was three something

01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:54.460
I don't know the exact answer change. Yeah. Yeah, so six feet is a little under two meters. Yeah, but you can't like

01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:58.540
Okay, how many cups in a liter? I don't know because the same reason

01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:00.780
Hell's wrong

01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:04.380
Okay, well, I know these things

01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:08.700
Four cups to a liter four liters to a gallon. Is it exactly though ish? No, it's not

01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:14.140
Don't worry about it. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It could how many pounds to a kilo. I don't know

01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:16.860
What the hell it's 2.2

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:21.900
But not exactly because it goes beyond the how many kilometers in a while. I don't know 1.6

01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:24.860
But it's not exactly because it goes beyond the point. It doesn't matter

01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:31.740
It does if you're giving it to them the fans that are gonna like things about the lab are gonna want exact conversions

01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.900
Does it have to do with anything what do you mean?

01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:42.620
No, I don't mean for the videos. I just mean you should know like to function. I know the rough stuff. Yeah, well then why don't you?

01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:50.220
If you ask my dad he'll give you the actual exact thing. Oh my god, that doesn't matter

01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:57.900
But that's why I just say like I don't know because if I say it wrong, he'll be like no and then give me the actual one

01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.900
I'm like, oh, I don't care

01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:05.020
I don't know. You just got to know this stuff like five mils in a teaspoon 15 mils in a tablespoon like you just

01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:07.100
you just

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:09.100
When you grow up with it, I mean think about it

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:15.500
What's the difference between memorizing one asinine method of measuring things and another

01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:21.820
Smarter but also, you know pretty complicated when you're when you're nine and you're learning it or whatever

01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:27.340
Method of measuring just memorize both of them then who cares see like blue fahrenheit though

01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:33.660
Blue furl said 3.2 feet in a meter, but it's actually 3.28. So it's more accurately 3.3

01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:36.780
So like you're off. It's a food three dairy

01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:43.100
What if it does fahrenheit? I cannot do though and it's funny because for the pool and like for the hot tub

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:48.940
I know it right like over 100 in the hot tub was hot enough that my aunt wouldn't let me get in

01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:55.260
Yeah, you know, you know the points that like mean something. Yes. Yeah, but if you and and I know that I know that

01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:57.020
like

01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:59.020
100 degrees

01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:04.940
Our 100 fahrenheit is like freaking hot weather. Yeah, like like unbearably hot weather and so I could kind of go

01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:08.780
Okay, it's probably like 42 or something, but then because the units

01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:10.060
It's

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:12.940
Don't like they get really similarly. Yeah

01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:17.820
If I remember correctly google the google weather app could not display

01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.620
69 degrees fahrenheit

01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:27.660
And people thought they were like trying to avoid the funny number, but it actually turned out that when you convert from celcius due to like

01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:35.740
Uh, how things round and whatnot. It never came out to 69 degrees fahrenheit. That's funny. So they had to like change how they

01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:41.100
I think it would they were cutting off too many decimal points. Oh, they had to stop cutting off so many decimal points

01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:45.020
So that they could actually get that was apple. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I just read some article on it

01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:49.340
I thought it was pretty funny people are quizzing me now. How many pounds to a stone. I don't know stone

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:55.100
Yeah, we don't deal with stone at all. We we never do stone is about 14 pounds to a stone

01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:57.900
Is that right? Okay

01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:01.340
For stone and seven years ago. Sorry. Uh, what we're talking about

01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:08.780
I think it was the zuckerberg. Oh, yeah. Yeah, weight difference because they're they're 30 pounds. Yeah, roughly 30 pounds

01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:12.540
So that's about 12 kilos. See, I don't need to know exactly

01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:20.220
Yeah, they're about 12 13 somewhere in there 30 pounds 12

01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:23.580
Seems accurate enough

01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:27.180
Why don't we talk about amazon 20 kilograms? It's about 45 pounds

01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:32.140
Yes, yeah, yeah, 44 44 point something

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:41.900
Amazon allegedly retaliates against critical news coverage. Uh, this was covered on dexerto

01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:46.700
Ah, great. Hey, there you go. Amazon shuts down

01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:53.820
Smart home after delivery driver. Miss hears racism from a doorbell

01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:56.780
Wait, what is this?

01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:59.660
Yeah, so loose rosman talked about this a while ago

01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:02.220
I don't think we have a lot of notes about the actual thing that happened

01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:07.180
But basically a doorbell the person wasn't even home the doorbell has a standard greeting and it is not racist

01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:13.900
Are you sure the deliverable? No, actually the delivery driver had headphones in or on or whatever and they thought it was racist

01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:17.340
So they reported it and amazon just like shut down

01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:20.300
Their home devices. Wow. Yeah

01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:28.860
I mean, I'm not saying that you should program your smart home to be racist. That would be stupid to be clear

01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:32.780
I don't think they did no, I know I know like I'm not saying that that would be okay

01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:38.140
But yeah, but for a company to have the ability to shut down your product that you bought

01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:44.220
Because you allegedly and it has things to do with like home security and used it in such a way. Yeah

01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:48.620
That is whoa mind-blowing according to the customer

01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:55.900
He was locked out of all of his smart devices without notice for a week pending investigation and this is

01:48:56.620 --> 01:49:01.900
Uh after they misheard a generic greeting from his yufi doorbell. Oh good yufi is back

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:09.580
No one was home at the time of the incident which rosman confirmed after being provided the customer's security footage

01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:16.380
amazon later acknowledged this incident and said it was looking at ways to prevent a similar situation from happening again

01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:22.700
So this wasn't even something that took place over an amazon owned like a ring doorbell

01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:25.900
This is something that just an amazon

01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:31.020
Driver complained about and they basically went okay your customer history

01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:38.380
All your stuff. I guess by serial number is shut down. It's down. It's out. It's gone. Oh, no, I guess it would just be by account

01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:40.380
Yeah, it'd be by account login

01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:48.220
The week after his reporting rosman received an email from amazon saying that his application to the amazon associates program

01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:54.140
Did not qualify and that his temporarily approved account has been rejected

01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:56.700
Which he's had for eight years

01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:05.420
The amazon email further accused lewis and I can tell you guys look I

01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:12.300
I have not followed mr. Rossman around day and night for the last eight years

01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:15.660
Looking over his shoulder monitoring his behavior

01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:21.740
But as someone who knows him, I think well enough to say what i'm about to say

01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:28.460
I'm gonna say what i'm about to say amazon accused rosman of using friends family and employees

01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:34.140
To fraudulently purchase products for the sake of affiliate kickbacks. That is a f***ing lie

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:37.100
That is

01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:39.100
Categorically false

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:44.940
I have never seen anything about lewis and his conduct that would lead me to believe that that is even

01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:47.660
Remotely a possibility. Yeah

01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:51.420
And i'll also say

01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:54.780
Having had our own amazon affiliate program scare in the past

01:50:55.180 --> 01:51:02.060
That the way that amazon chooses to enforce the rules and regulations of that program are scattershot at best

01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:04.460
And I wouldn't put it past them

01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:10.460
To target a particular creator with some kind of nonsense made up reason for ejecting them from the program

01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:16.860
I don't know if you guys remember the drama that we went through. We only narrowly got our account reinstated

01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:22.940
And the reason that we were that we were kicked out allegedly was because we said that

01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:25.980
Um using our affiliate code helped support us

01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:28.060
That apparently

01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:36.220
Violated their policy because it provided something in kind for using our affiliate program what gratitude and they're like, yeah

01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:38.940
And i'm sitting here going

01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:44.300
Basically every twitch streamer has a banner under their channel. That's like support me by buying

01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:47.180
S*** on amazon using my account. Oh, yeah

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:50.220
So well, what's with that?

01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:53.820
And it was only after we showed them our substantial

01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:58.620
Daily subscriber growth that they reconsidered our case and honestly

01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:02.220
It was hard even getting to that point where we could talk to a real human being about the appeal

01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:04.940
Um, so yeah based on my experience

01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:09.100
I could see them having very

01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:12.620
A very uneven approach to applying their

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.100
seemingly

01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:20.940
Completely opaque set of rules like how was I supposed to know that based on how everyone else was using it and

01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:23.900
I mean, I wasn't trying to get snitch, right?

01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:25.500
But I did have to

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:31.260
Provide evidence that other creators were doing the same thing. None of them got their affiliate programs pulled which is good

01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:34.460
Which is good, but also I should never have gotten mind pulled then

01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:35.980
Yeah

01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:37.820
ridiculous

01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:39.820
To be clear we've had a pretty

01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:42.620
smooth relationship with amazon over

01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:49.100
I don't know the last while. Yeah, I just see the business team say that like they're doing good or something

01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:52.060
That that's all I actually know about it these days

01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:57.020
Um, and it's like it's all affiliate based like before I think or have they sponsored some stuff

01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.660
They might have sponsored a video or two actually now that I think about it

01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:01.500
So things have been pretty smooth for us

01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:06.060
But it wasn't always like that and with the way that they just treat the affiliate program

01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:09.180
Not as a discount, but as like a marketing exercise

01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:12.700
I could absolutely see them being like this isn't worth it. Forget it. Just cut it off

01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:15.260
Provide some bs reason. It doesn't matter

01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.260
um

01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:19.020
Yeah, that's

01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:21.100
That's not cool. Um

01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:24.780
Yeah, our discussion question

01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:29.660
What's more plausible that lewis rossmann has been getting his employees to buy soldering tools on mass

01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:37.340
For hundreds of dollars in kickbacks or that a petty middle manager at amazon revoked the affiliate count of an outspoken critic with 1.8 million subscribers

01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:45.740
Yeah, it's kind of rough

01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:51.020
I

01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:56.060
Terrible terrible, maybe we can get bezos into the cage match

01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:04.540
That'll be rossmann. That'd be pretty good. No, I don't think rossmann needs to fight bezos. He's pretty short. Oh wait

01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:07.580
No, sorry. I meant the previous one. Yeah, I just make it like

01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:13.820
You know, they'd fare a lot better if it was like an elon and bezos tag team versus mark

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:16.380
You think so? I don't think so

01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:20.300
Oh, well, yeah, I don't know if bezos has actual like fight training though

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:23.260
Oh, yeah, but because you're in shape doesn't mean at least there's two no

01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:24.300
I completely agree

01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:31.180
But i'm saying at least there's two of them like increases chances a little bit you missed the uh like you missed the uh the arcade day

01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:37.260
Yeah, he was sick. Um, but they had like one of those punching bags that like measures how hard it hits the thing

01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:38.620
and

01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:41.420
I was like very close to people who weigh like

01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:45.020
20 30 percent more than me because it's so much of it is technique

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:51.340
Yeah, yeah, and so just because you're strong or heavy doesn't actually mean you can hit hard. Yeah, um

01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:56.220
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I think I'd still take zuckerberg

01:54:57.180 --> 01:55:01.340
Do you think you would take zuckerberg? No, oh heavens. No, I don't want to fight mark. I was like, whoa

01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:05.260
I mean, give me like

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:09.740
Give me a year

01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:14.300
Of like training. Yeah, like I'd have to actually train like I have to dial down work

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:19.020
Yeah, I have I have some martial arts background already. I wouldn't be coming from ground zero

01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:23.260
I would really want to improve my flexibility and I'd really want to improve my stamina

01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:25.420
And I really need to work on like ground

01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:27.580
I was gonna say as far as my understanding goes

01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:32.780
What you might want to work on is just intensely avoiding going to the ground because it takes a very long time

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:39.980
To learn jujitsu and I think he's been doing it for quite a while. Um, okay, so basically I just want to get focused on

01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:42.140
And you have no like

01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:45.660
Sorry, what is it? What is the thing that you do again? I don't I don't say what it is

01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:49.020
Okay, that's fine because it's like kind of random. It's a combination of like

01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:52.460
You do some kind of kickboxing stuff some taekwondo

01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:57.740
I'd say probably it's most based on taekwondo, but none of the most none of it's grand, right?

01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:00.540
You know, we do some grappling you do some grab some not much

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:04.700
Okay, very little at least you have some though because a lot of people will come with like no wrestling

01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:10.060
No jujitsu and think they're just gonna like bear hug people and win and just get wreck. Oh, yeah, that's not how that works. Yeah

01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:12.700
Um

01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:17.420
It's been a long time though. It's been a very long time since I've done like any kind of grappling stuff

01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:23.260
No, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna fight mark zuckerberg. That's just that's just not worth it. That's probably good

01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:29.900
Uh, moving on though. Yeah, we've got to explain merch messages. Yes, you guys are probably seeing these down here

01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:34.140

02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:43.740
Whoa, that's the goal

02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:46.700
We want to we want to minimize lines. We want to maximize engagement

02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:51.020

Nope, don't see it. Okay, cool. Good chat everyone

02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:21.980
Dan you want to hit us with a couple merge messages?

02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:23.660
Sure thing. Yeah, I got a couple here for you

02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:27.500
Linus you mentioned a couple of weeks back regretting naming the company after yourself

02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:31.660
I had the same regret and wondered what other names you've pondered since

02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:35.020
Nope

02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:40.220
Because we still might need some of those. Yeah, that's a problem with that. We do have a couple of good ones

02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:43.580
Oh, this could be a way for me to win the debate

02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:48.140
I just leak all the ones that I don't like. Oh, that is so lame

02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:50.860
That's how we end up with linus media group

02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:56.380
That's not fair. That is fair because we wanted to change it. You said no

02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:05.580
So that that actually is fair. Well, this isn't exactly how we ended up with linus media group. It's pretty close. Um

02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:08.700
Hmm, it's pretty close. I'm sorry luke

02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:13.340
I didn't know I actually can't remember any of them off the top of my head right now

02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:16.540
And a quick search of my inbox did not bring up the one that I want

02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:21.420
Which I thought might be also in an email chain with the ones that I don't want. Got them

02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:27.580
Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to do that. Honestly. I think I think austin's company name is really good

02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:31.020
It's overclock media. I'm like, yeah, okay. It's sort of

02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:36.780
Meaningless to anyone who doesn't know what it is, but it's super geeky and fun for people who do know what it is

02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:39.020
I think something like that would be that's way better

02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:45.500
Underclock media. Yeah, I mean if I was to do it again today, it would be yvonne umbrella corporation

02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:49.020
yuck

02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:56.140
And yvonne would hate it. Oh, yeah, she she hates that I talk about it even yeah, yeah, yeah

02:03:56.700 --> 02:03:59.500
Yeah, she doesn't think it's funny. Yeah, I do

02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:03.100
I continue to think it's funny then hit me with one more

02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:10.860
Thanks for all your work feelings about parasocial perception to me when is spicy take dragon firebrand

02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:13.500
gentle giant bird boy

02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:15.660
and adult in the room

02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:17.980
But I'm sure you're all much more complex

02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:27.020
Well, um, who's the adult in the room? I really hope they were not referring to me. I really hope not either because I

02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:32.940
Thought I was bird boy. I think I'm the lightest of the three of us

02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:37.500
Some of you were loudest we were talking about that

02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:44.860
I'd take care I do like sea shanties bringing you to the vet

02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:49.260
His birds like sea shanties they do they do that's a good reference

02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:53.740
Uh, wow, okay. Uh hit me with one more

02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:55.420
Sure

02:04:55.420 --> 02:05:00.460
Hey Linus and luke are there any specific tech innovations or developments on the horizon that you believe will

02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:04.220
significantly impact the average consumer in the near future

02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:10.060
Man, it's not so much the things that are on the horizon right now as the things that we've allowed to creep up on us

02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:17.340
I think that that previous topic we just talked about where we don't own our devices and the companies that sold them to us can just

02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:23.020
Turn them off at a whim whether it's a hardware product or whether it's a software product like a game

02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:26.060
Oh, I'm sorry. You bought this for the multiplayer experience

02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:29.900
Well, we turned off the servers and I guess you just don't get to play that multiplayer experience anymore

02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:33.500
Oh, you thought maybe you would share it with your kids. Nope. They don't get to play it either

02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:37.660
Nobody gets to play it. Haha. See you later. By the way, we've got a remastered one

02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:40.620
That is bundled with the sequel that you can buy for full price

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:47.020
Or worse yet, we don't have anything and there's absolutely no way to to relive that joy

02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:48.540
Um, you know that sucks

02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:54.620
We don't want you playing that type of game right now because we need our new type of monetization to be the only thing that you can access

02:05:55.820 --> 02:06:02.780
Yeah, there's there's stuff like um, there's a cyber tax going on from china right now on us infrastructure

02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:04.300
and it's like

02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:05.500
not

02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:10.540
Actual shutting things down. It's just getting themselves in the system and then sitting there

02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:15.180
What is this? Sorry? I'm not familiar with this. Can you explain it a little better than that?

02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:19.340
Reading some articles recently on how there's there's constantly cyber warfare

02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:22.380
From all of the countries to all of the other countries

02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:28.060
So this is not like weird and i'm sure america is doing very similar things back. I'm not trying to be like oh china bad

02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:29.660
um

02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:32.860
But but but dictator what I have heard bill biden said

02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:38.060
What I have heard recently is that there was recently a

02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:43.420
fairly significant amount of chinese cyber attacks towards american infrastructure

02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:46.220
Think like power stations sure stuff like that

02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:50.780
Um, and they weren't trying to actively take anything down

02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:57.980
They were just trying to get in the systems so that maybe they could if they wanted to right and I think if there was bad

02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:04.380
Yes, and china needs to not do that. I think bad china in very stux net type of ways if there was

02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:07.260
a a large future

02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:10.220
World scale war

02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:14.220
That was to happen that involved these big countries very directly

02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:19.420
Those types of things would start happening in ways that I don't think anyone's ready for literally at all

02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:26.060
Right like all of the power and all of the internet just being incredibly unstable in all of the places

02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:28.060
Is something that

02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:31.020
We're not ready for we're very used to stability all these other types of things

02:07:31.420 --> 02:07:32.540
um

02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:35.580
Yeah, I mean even a residential internet connection

02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:41.340
I think about how often my internet goes down at home almost never compared to when I was a teenager

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:44.060
Oh, yeah, it was constantly down

02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:48.460
It was it was a it was a a die roll whether it would connect or not

02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:51.500
Yeah, the telephone line was the only thing back then that was like reliable

02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:54.300
um

02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:58.060
So things being super stable is something that I think we take for granted

02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:02.940
And what what could throw that stability off? I think it's very wide ranging

02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:04.300
um

02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:07.420
So it might not it might not have to be some form of conflict or something like that

02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:11.580
but all of these different infrastructure things that we have being network connected for

02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:17.340
Simplicity's sake for ease of use for for all of these other variety of reasons

02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:22.620
So if you're you're saying that if I don't want the wancho to get shut down right now, I shouldn't say taiwanza country

02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:27.500
That's like hey, that might dude if the power went out right then

02:08:28.460 --> 02:08:30.460
so

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:37.260
Hey give them time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they got only type so fast to it. Yeah. Yeah

02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:39.020
um

02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:42.380
Yeah, I don't know. I think that is an interesting thing though

02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:48.300
Is that so many things are network connected at this point right people have network connected locks

02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:50.380
right like

02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:54.700
And and one of the things is when you have when you have something like a network connected door lock to your house

02:08:55.180 --> 02:09:00.540
If all you use for a very very long time is like your phone or something to get into your house

02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:02.860
You might start becoming

02:09:03.420 --> 02:09:06.860
Less concerned about making sure that you have your backup key on you or whatever else

02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:12.940
So like there's there's things that just get a little weird when those systems stop working in the way that they have forever

02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:17.260
I I stopped carrying the like baller fancy key for the office for a long time

02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:20.780
Because I was just like I will always get in with my oh the power's out

02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:25.100
Yep, and then I just like I didn't have it and I had to drive all the way back home

02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:29.340
Dig it out of whatever stupid. That's why my keychain weighs like four pounds

02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:31.260
um

02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:33.260
because I just

02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:35.740
I've gone through it. I'm like no

02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:44.140
No, I actually do need physical keys for physical locks. Yeah, um, but no, I get it type of stuff. Yeah 100 percent. Yeah. Yeah

02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:46.460
Yeah

02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:54.060
Not to doom and gloom it, but there we go. I just bought a mystery water bottle wondering if you would discuss taiwan

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:59.980
I mean, we're not exactly discussing it. But what that really that's on your wancho bingo

02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:04.460
Not luke's mom calls

02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:11.660
It's been a while for that one. I like throw my phone away these days. So that might be a little bit more difficult

02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:14.860
Yeah, luke's phone causes so much

02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:18.700
Like actually can't hold it near the mic. You won't hear anything. Yeah

02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:27.660
All right, why don't we jump into del australia being found guilty of deceptive pricing not del

02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:29.900
How could they do this to us?

02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:36.460
An australian court has found del's australian subsidiary guilty of falsely marking computer prices as on sale

02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:41.740
According to documents published by the court customers buying a pre-built computer online

02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:45.900
We're given the option of an add-on monitor listed as 60 off

02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:50.220
However, the discounted price was simply the full price of the product

02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:54.060
The monitor had never been listed for the striked out price

02:10:54.380 --> 02:11:02.060
Some customers were even misled into purchasing the monitors at a higher rate than they would have paid had they purchased the monitor by itself

02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:06.060
The court claims that more than 5,300 add-on monitors were sold

02:11:06.300 --> 02:11:08.300
with overstated discounts

02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:14.220
Del has admitted to misleading customers and has been ordered to hire an independent compliance professional

02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:20.060
And compensate any customers who bought the falsely labeled products. The court is currently taking

02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:23.820
Commentary on what further penalties to levy against the company

02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:28.460
Here's the thing first of all

02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:35.420
I want to say shout out australia for actually enforcing this stuff. Yeah, that's awesome because canada for example

02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:37.740
has laws that prevent you from just

02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:41.420
perpetually having something on sale and

02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:44.140
Fun story

02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:46.860
Do you know why NCIX had a weekly sale?

02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:51.100
So you could effectively do that

02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:57.820
Yeah, so the sale would end so you probably like day night rotate some of the items but not all of them

02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:00.860
The sale would end Tuesday night

02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:03.340
Then Wednesday day

02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:11.100
We'd sell basically nothing because everything was at rando stupid prices because they were just set by the system at some safe

02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:13.100
We definitely won't lose money level

02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:15.420
Okay, and then

02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:17.820
Wednesday night at 6 p.m

02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:21.180
Ideally sometimes it was late. We would launch the sale

02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:24.700
Send out the email newsletter. I remember these and then

02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:29.660
Rinse and repeat and rinse and repeat and you basically like only buy the bundles and stuff

02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:34.700
And you only buy the things that are in the weekly sale because everything else is not priced properly. Oh by the way

02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:37.740
Because people only buy what's in the sale

02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:42.460
You just put everything that people want in the sale like man it got to the point where there were like 800 items

02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:45.660
Oh, yeah, it's something stupid like that. You couldn't actually scroll through it

02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:50.860
Like you'd have everything you'd have like packs of 25 blank CDs in the sale because

02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:57.900
We needed to we needed to move them and having them at regular price, you know, wasn't effective because the site was unnavigable

02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:03.260
Oh, so um, yeah, that that was why it was in case anyone ever got mad at us

02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:06.700
But as far as I can tell nobody ever gets mad at anybody for it

02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:12.780
Like think man the number of furniture stores. Oh, yeah in Surrey that literally have like

02:13:13.420 --> 02:13:18.380
Faded going out of business banners hanging on like six years ago sometimes

02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:23.500
Yeah, from just sitting in the sun for literally the better part of a decade. Yeah, um

02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:26.220
I don't know man. I just

02:13:26.220 --> 02:13:32.220
Anyway, that's cool. Shout out Australia for actually doing anything about this because it's stupid

02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:34.540
Everything must go car dealerships. Yeah

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.140
Yeah

02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:38.540
Yeah, everything must go eventually

02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:43.740
And then we'll get yeah, we'll take it. We'll take your trade in. Yeah, take your trade and then that must go

02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:53.260
Um, I I like it none of this none of this surprises me from del and I

02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:56.060
Ah

02:13:56.060 --> 02:13:58.780
And I'm I'm happy to see someone actually paying the price

02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:01.820
I love that they have to compensate the customers directly

02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:07.020
They don't say how much and they are seeking further information though. So well, how do you think they should do it?

02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:09.180
Do you have any opinions on that? I've been trying to figure that out

02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:12.140
I

02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:15.420
Because I say compensate them, but they don't say compensate them by how much

02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:20.060
Well, I would assume that they just need to I would assume they just need to pay back the extra

02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:23.420
But then again, so the difference because they bought it at

02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:29.020
Normal price. They just thought they were getting it. Okay. I have no idea how they would this would wreck them looking at the

02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:33.180
Prices that I see on the screen, but it would be really great if they had to pay them the difference

02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:37.980
Yeah, that'd be a lot of money is that'd be like five million dollars

02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:45.260
Because it's a thousand dollar delta luke and there's five thousand add-on monitors that were sold with overstated discounts get owned

02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:47.260
Don't do it again. Yeah, I mean

02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:49.500
I

02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:56.780
I think that probably doesn't make a ton of sense given that it's not like these people bought it at the inflated price

02:14:57.340 --> 02:15:01.900
They bought it at regular price. They just just how do you how do you build the compensation package?

02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:03.820
I have no idea. I don't know the answer

02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:07.020
But I know that I'm happy they're doing something and that del's getting

02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:11.420
And I'm happy that the compensation is going to the individuals

02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:17.580
Personally rather than just being a fine that goes to the lawyers the government or lawyers that like

02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:24.780
Yeah, oh you get two dollars. Yeah, but I'm the one who got screwed. Yeah, like where's my check? Oh three dollars for my class

02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:30.780
That oh, thank you. Thank you. How much did the lawyers get? Oh millions. Oh cool. This is perfect. The system works. Yeah

02:15:32.060 --> 02:15:34.860
Yeah, I don't know. I just I hope it's not nothing

02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:36.780
because

02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:43.100
Like I want del to feel it. Yeah, whatever amount that is sounds good. I hope they figure it out

02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:45.100
All right

02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:52.860
What do you want to talk about next Luke? Uh people were saying that the intel arc a770 was uh discontinued. That is not true

02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:56.220
Intel has officially discontinued their arc a770

02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:04.460
Limited edition graphics cards meaning like the ones that like they're making and stuff. Yeah, but board partner cards are still available

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:06.700
This is super normal

02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:09.020
And people should stop freaking out

02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:10.780
Yes

02:16:10.780 --> 02:16:17.900
Yep, basically, I just don't think intel is interested in the low margin business of being an aib in the longer term

02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:20.300
Uh, it was pretty obvious from the name

02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:24.460
Limited edition that they intended to eventually

02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:33.020
This particular 16 gig version of the a770 people are just so obsessed with trying to call the skies falling on on intel arc

02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:34.540
Um

02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:37.340
But it's not so honestly. I'm surprised it lasted this long

02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:42.460
That's either an indication that it took a little bit longer for them to build up aib like add-in board partner

02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:45.100
relationships or that they

02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:48.780
Had a lot or yeah, or that they were selling really slow

02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:54.620
Compared to how many of them they had. Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not sure which way this went but it probably

02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:59.820
wasn't intel was selling too many a770 le's and just

02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:02.460
It's too profitable. We can't shut it down

02:17:03.420 --> 02:17:06.860
Yeah, probably not the problem. Yeah, probably not so much

02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:09.420
um

02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.500
What are we supposed to do? Oh, we should do sponsors

Wait, we have to do merge messages now, but there's so many topics dan

02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:04.140
There is when we didn't respond to the doc. They just prepped all of the topics. I see

02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:11.340
That's kind of on us. Uh, yes, uh, that's on you. I replied once I had the day off yesterday. Oh get on

02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:14.300
Well, I

02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:17.260
Did my best

02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:21.740
That's all we can ask for. All right hit me with a merge message. Sure thing

02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:29.100
Uh linus when you got the pie in the face during your last live stream, did you feel like mrs. Doubtfire for a moment?

02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:30.620
Uh, yes

02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:35.420
mrs. Doubtfire, but with more crust and not just uh the cream

02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:38.780
There was a lot of chunkies

02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:41.180
I smelled a lot like pie

02:20:42.060 --> 02:20:45.180
My whole face smelled like pie like all the beard and everything

02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:49.900
We did a guess the price wrong and get punished stream

02:20:50.460 --> 02:20:54.940
A lot of you probably haven't seen it. It seems like there's been some differences in

02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:59.420
The rate at which youtube serves out live stream vods

02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:02.380
So they used to get a bit of a harder push right out of the gate

02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:07.500
And then the slow burn and now it seems like they don't really get much of a push out of the gate

02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:10.620
And they're just a slow burn so over the next six months

02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:14.540
You'll probably see it recommended to you and youtube and then I guess click it then or whatever

02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:17.180
Um, but yeah, it doesn't have a lot of views yet

02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:21.820
But it's been it's what's quite well received and a lot of people have said it's like one of our best streams ever

02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:23.900
Basically, I had to build a computer

02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:27.660
But the catch is that I have to guess the price of every component

02:21:27.980 --> 02:21:31.500
And if i'm off by more than 10 percent, I get a I spin a punishment wheel

02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:35.100
And if i'm off by more than 20 percent, I spin a worse punishment wheel

02:21:35.580 --> 02:21:39.740
And if i'm off by more than 30 percent, I spin a really bad punishment wheel

02:21:39.980 --> 02:21:44.620
Let's just put it this way. I spun the 30 a lot of times

02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:53.180
Wow, I was actually going to say I'm assuming you did pretty good

02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:58.300
Well, they went out of their way to pick stuff that was really hard to guess. There's one that I flubbed

02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:00.140
I just

02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:02.700
I moved price tiers on myself

02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:09.820
I went okay, core i7 is like 400 and change core i5 is like 260 to 280

02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:20.860
Okay, but that was back when core i7 was the top of the range and also a while ago. Yeah. Yeah, so it was uh

02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:27.740
It was a core i7 and I went step down core i5

02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:35.100
Yeah, or wait, was it a core i5 I can't remember it was something the point was it wasn't what I thought it was

02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:37.260
And I forgot that we have a core i9 tier

02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:43.500
I just completely spaced because I was hosting a stream and trying to guess a thing and it had been a long day

02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:46.540
Week month 10 years

02:22:46.540 --> 02:22:49.260
Um, and I just completely spaced on it

02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:54.780
And that was supposed to be the easy one. So I was off by more than 30 right out of the gate

02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:57.420
I got a dollop of hot sauce to bomb

02:22:58.540 --> 02:23:00.780
Yeah, so I was feeling that yesterday

02:23:01.660 --> 02:23:06.540
I heard it was hot sauce. I didn't realize it was like hot hot sauce. I always assumed it was going to be something

02:23:06.700 --> 02:23:14.220
It wasn't Tabasco. Yeah. Yeah, the lower tiers were a weaker hot sauce. Um, anyway, so yeah, it was a dollop of

02:23:14.780 --> 02:23:20.140
Most people do like one drop. Oh, it was a lot more than a drop. Yeah, it was it was it was some

02:23:20.860 --> 02:23:26.700
Um, so then right out of the gate, I did terrible and then most of the items they picked were designed to be difficult to guess

02:23:27.100 --> 02:23:31.980
So for the motherboard, for example, it was like a sonic the hedgehog themed board from azeroc. Oh

02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:36.300
How much would that cost? I have no idea. No idea

02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:38.300
400

02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:43.420
Yeah, that's about what I said. It was it was 250. Wow, that's a lot. The thing is it could go any direction

02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:46.860
It could be a ton because it's super limited edition and

02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:52.700
And it like lights up with a crazy produced only a few of them and they're super in demand

02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:57.500
It makes a coin or it could be basically nothing because they produced a few of them and nobody bought them

02:23:57.580 --> 02:24:01.180
And they just discounted them to get them out trying to get rid of like I don't know

02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:05.900
I don't know how much demand there is for a sonic the hedgehog motherboard. Yeah, that's ridiculous

02:24:06.220 --> 02:24:08.220
So there was a lot of stuff like that

02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:11.020
They be trolling you

02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:12.540
Yeah

02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:14.540
Linus didn't chew the hot sauce

02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:18.300
You need to or it burns your stomach. What on earth are you talking about?

02:24:19.180 --> 02:24:22.620
Also, the number of people that were like Linus, don't drink water. It makes it worse

02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:25.420
I don't know. Maybe for you

02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:28.300
Water definitely helps for me. It's just like

02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:34.460
Oh, uh, we had an acoustic panel just fall off the ceiling it

02:24:36.220 --> 02:24:38.220
Just about hit Dan

02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:41.900
So that's funny. I mean, it's not as funny as if it did hit

02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:44.780
That would have been great

02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:50.940
They're not heavy. Don't worry. Wow. Um, what was I saying? Uh hot sauce water you find it helps

02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:56.220
Yeah, yeah, I find it helps even it even just like the cooling like the soothing people are like, but it spreads the capsaicin

02:24:56.620 --> 02:25:03.260
Like that that doesn't bother me spreading it out. It's more better. Yeah. Um, and like yes. Yes milk works better

02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:05.500
Where the f*** am I gonna get milk?

02:25:05.980 --> 02:25:07.500
I'm at work

02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:09.500
I'm not at home

02:25:10.460 --> 02:25:12.460
Just like the number of people like

02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:16.540
Yes, I know

02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:21.100
I'm at work. Uh, yes, my mouth is burning. Let me drive to the grocery store

02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:31.900
Just the kind of like pompous like

02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:35.100
Yeah

02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:41.180
Go back to reddit. Oh wait got them. They're spilling out. Yeah

02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:49.420
Uh, no milk at the office. WTF. Why would there be milk at the office? Like creamers maybe but milk. Why?

02:25:50.300 --> 02:25:52.060
Yeah

02:25:52.060 --> 02:25:54.060
That'd be a little weird. Anywho

02:25:54.380 --> 02:25:56.380
Um

02:25:57.340 --> 02:25:59.340
Get milk for work

02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:01.500
No

02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:02.700
No

02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:04.700
Why?

02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:10.940
Like what are you guys even talking about milk is good. So what so buy it at home. Yeah and drink it there. Yeah

02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:14.220
Yeah, no, we're not providing milk

02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:17.340
What do I look like to you a cow?

02:26:21.420 --> 02:26:23.660
That was so much worse

02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:30.460
Oh man, you guys are killing me

02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:36.700
What

02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:45.340
What are we supposed to be doing right now? I have to read you another merge message. Okay

02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:50.860
I I will try to read you

02:26:51.180 --> 02:26:54.380
Lightest milks himself on my bingo card. I just

02:26:57.500 --> 02:26:59.500
Why don't I want a cup of coffee now?

02:27:04.940 --> 02:27:06.940
Okay, let's uh

02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:12.060
Okay, whoo. All right, I listened to the way

02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:14.380
I really didn't see that coming

02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:17.100
Who got a bingo post-in chat?

02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:21.820
I listen to the wanjo every week despite not being subbed to any lmg channels

02:27:22.220 --> 02:27:29.740
Have you noticed any similar trends of people regularly consuming lmg content without being in the larger ecosystem?

02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:36.780
Absolutely. I mean the proportion of subscribed versus not subscribed viewers has gone down over the years and

02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:41.820
Like for okay. Here's another here's another sort of supporting piece of of evidence

02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:44.620
Over probably about the last

02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:50.220
Six months. I don't know. I'd have to double check to be sure but over an extended period of time

02:27:50.700 --> 02:27:52.700
We've seen an uptick

02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:54.700
in channel views

02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:58.940
Without the traditional corresponding uptick in subscribers

02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:03.740
I think a lot of people just don't care anymore. They know it like barely does anything and they just don't even bother interact with it

02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:08.460
Yeah, the numbers the numbers just don't really seem to have much to do with

02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:14.220
The kinds of ratios that they used to have like that. I don't know. I just I can't really find a pattern to it

02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:15.980
um

02:28:15.980 --> 02:28:19.100
We don't actively call out subscriptions as much anymore

02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:23.900
But then when we stopped doing that it made effectively zero difference whatsoever

02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:29.980
Because there's like the the noise there is pretty intense too. You get callouts for subscriptions in every single video

02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:34.220
So you just start ignoring it. It reminds you of the like, oh, yeah, I should click on something else now

02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:38.620
Some channels see a big uptick in subscribers from shorts. We've had some shorts go

02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:41.260
pretty successful ish

02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:47.500
Negligible absolutely nothing like no impact. Uh, I I don't know. I just I just don't know what I don't know

02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:52.940
I have to tell you guys other than that clearly you don't care about subscribers or like being subscribed to channels and

02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:56.380
You're depending more and more on youtube recommendations

02:28:57.100 --> 02:28:59.580
YouTube, you know for you and all that kind of stuff

02:29:00.380 --> 02:29:07.020
And that's a double-edged sword right like on the one hand. It's allowed us to reach a much larger audience than we otherwise would have been able to

02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:08.540
I mean even

02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:14.060
When subscribe subscriptions were more important. They still weren't that effective people just get fatigued right?

02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:18.700
They don't they don't want that many notifications if you're subscribed to more than like half a dozen

02:29:18.780 --> 02:29:22.620
Maybe a dozen youtube channels. You're gonna be like, eh screw this like forget it's too much

02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:25.180
Right, so you can't get a notification

02:29:25.500 --> 02:29:27.500
Anytime a channel that you follow does anything

02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:33.180
And so it allows you to reach these people who are either not subscribed or are subscription fatigued, right?

02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:38.860
But then the flip side of it is that if you are not performing in a way that is favored by

02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:42.460
the uh, the way that youtube serves

02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:44.940
content to the audience

02:29:44.940 --> 02:29:46.940
That's my way of saying the algorithm

02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:51.020
Um, because youtube will say it's the audience and I will say

02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:55.580
Right, but can you explain to me why a live stream vaude

02:29:56.140 --> 02:29:59.580
Follows a very different curve from a regular video upload

02:30:00.060 --> 02:30:03.260
Surely that could not purely be audience preference

02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:06.140
right

02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:07.900
Crickets

02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:11.340
so there's definitely an algorithmic component to it, but

02:30:12.140 --> 02:30:19.420
What i'm trying to say is if you no longer appeal to the way that youtube recommends content to the audience then

02:30:20.380 --> 02:30:25.740
You're not gonna perform. Uh, we are on our way into a very deep trough

02:30:26.460 --> 02:30:30.540
And honestly a big part of it feels like kind of a hangover

02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:37.260
I've started to notice this for many years. Our growth was slow and steady. We just built the back catalog

02:30:38.140 --> 02:30:42.140
Built evergreen content that would I don't know. Maybe it's only 200 views a day

02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:44.460
Maybe it's only 100 views a day

02:30:44.460 --> 02:30:46.460
But more than zero views a day

02:30:46.940 --> 02:30:49.660
Just built up and built up and built up so our daily viewership went

02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:52.460
Grow grow grow grow grow grow and then

02:30:53.260 --> 02:30:57.180
It's gotten more turbulent. It's down. It's up. It's down. It's up. It's down. It's up. It's down. It's up

02:30:57.420 --> 02:31:03.500
And I think part of that is just being kind of saturated like I can't talk to a tech savvy person who has never heard

02:31:03.980 --> 02:31:05.980
of any of our channels

02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:08.140
They exist

02:31:08.140 --> 02:31:11.340
But it's pretty unusual these days. So I think part of it is like a saturation

02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:15.500
And part of it is just like a natural interest cycle

02:31:15.820 --> 02:31:18.700
You know, we'll go through a period where the channel is

02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:25.340
Everywhere and it's probably all over your recommended and you're probably watching a ton of the videos and then

02:31:26.220 --> 02:31:28.460
I don't know. It's like I love zero punctuation

02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:30.940
When's the last time I watched one? Yeah

02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:34.620
Yeah, I just I leave it alone for a bit and then like I'll go back and binge it or like a

02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:37.900
I'm that way with tv shows and stuff as well. Like I just

02:31:38.780 --> 02:31:40.700
kind of fall off and then

02:31:40.700 --> 02:31:42.220
I'll go back to it or

02:31:42.220 --> 02:31:47.180
Sometimes I won't and that's just sort of like the natural the natural cyclone. So right now

02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:49.660
We're

02:31:49.660 --> 02:31:54.460
We dipped today to a level that I don't think we've seen in like a couple of years

02:31:55.020 --> 02:31:58.940
But then we're coming off of some highs that we hadn't seen

02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:02.700
In a couple of years and I think it's just uh

02:32:03.340 --> 02:32:07.020
Yeah, it's a natural thing. I think part of it is that yesterday's video sucked

02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:10.460
Just that did wow did that ever not perform?

02:32:10.780 --> 02:32:12.780
But part of it is also just that

02:32:13.180 --> 02:32:17.820
Interest waxing and waning because we've uploaded some really good content in the last little bit

02:32:18.300 --> 02:32:23.660
That hasn't performed well either and I think is just going to be a slower burn as it gets served to people

02:32:24.060 --> 02:32:29.260
The only you can fix gpu pricing. Here's how video is like really good. The feedback on this is

02:32:30.060 --> 02:32:36.140
Amazing people love it. They're like, this is like mini scrapyard words. This is awesome like 98 and a half percent like dislike ratio

02:32:36.220 --> 02:32:38.220
People clipped you yelling at yourself

02:32:38.860 --> 02:32:41.420
That happens like pretty early on I had at least

02:32:42.300 --> 02:32:47.580
Like I don't know eight plus people send that to me. Yeah, like that that was extremely

02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:52.700
Like that was one of the worst performing videos out of the last couple of weeks

02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:58.460
Uh, which is yeah, it's like remarkable to me. Uh, the framework factory tour is awesome

02:32:59.180 --> 02:33:04.300
That'll do well in the long term, but it was a below average performer. So there's just no, um

02:33:06.460 --> 02:33:14.620
Yeah, yeah, it's tough. Um, then we had the the apple event, which was honestly speaking a video we threw together

02:33:15.260 --> 02:33:21.580
I wasn't even in office that day. I had to review the script in like 20 minutes. Um, and it's got like 3 million views

02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:26.860
It's a top. It's a top performer. So I do have to wonder if there's a little bit of like that video was everywhere

02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:32.780
And then people are just like, uh, you know, uh, oh, we are that guy again. Okay. I'll get I'll catch up later

02:33:32.780 --> 02:33:34.780
I don't know it. So it's always like that, right?

02:33:35.260 --> 02:33:37.260
um

02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:39.020
So we'll see

02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:40.220
See how it goes

02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:44.460
Got some pretty good ideas for some stuff coming up and we'll we'll we'll get back to it, but

02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:47.740
It's a it's a wild

02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:52.860
It's a wild ocean that we are that we're swimming in. I forget what the point of all of this was. Where did we start?

02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:58.940
Genuinely don't know a merch message. Oh, yeah, do people watch channels. They don't subscribe to right, right, right, right, right

02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:01.340
Yeah, that's a funny thing too. I see that often

02:34:01.740 --> 02:34:07.260
Is there'll be like a wave of comments people will be tweeting at me or commenting or whatever like man

02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:11.500
I didn't get this video in my subscription feed. I I feel like I haven't been getting your videos lately

02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:16.700
And then they'll come seeking us out again. And then the channel momentum will swing up and I'm like

02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:19.500
Okay, well, I didn't do anything different

02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:21.180
yeah

02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:25.740
I'll find that sometimes like I feel like I click on a creator every time I ever see one of their videos

02:34:25.820 --> 02:34:27.740
I really enjoy their stuff

02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:32.780
And then I'll I'll go like wait. I haven't seen a video from this group in a while or whatever

02:34:33.020 --> 02:34:35.900
Let me go look what what they're doing. It's like, oh, they've been doing

02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:40.780
Twice a week uploads for the last six months and I just haven't noticed so you go and you binge a few and then

02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:45.820
It's nothing but that and everything. Yeah, it's like, well, okay. Hold on. This is a bit much. Yeah

02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:48.140
Yeah, and then it keeps going

02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:50.620
Yeah

02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:53.500
Hit me with one more dan and then we'll get on to some more topics that sounds great

02:34:54.140 --> 02:35:00.300
Okay, let's see. Hey, lld. Thanks for another awesome show after seeing the we head video. I'm curious

02:35:00.700 --> 02:35:06.300
Where do you see communications technology in 10 to 20 years? What do you think will be the next big leap?

02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:09.100
I mean, I think that this

02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:11.660
10 to 20 years is a lot

02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:18.780
But in the next five years, we are almost certainly headed to some form of metaverse style communication

02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:22.540
I mean you look at the way that apple's moving face time onto the tv

02:35:23.100 --> 02:35:24.860
You look at the way that

02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:30.140
Meta and apple are trying to get us interacting with a with a headset something that sits

02:35:30.620 --> 02:35:35.500
Right in front of our eyes. If it's not augmented reality, which is a funny thing

02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:37.900
Do you notice apple refuses to use the term ar?

02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:40.540
grow up

02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:42.540
It is

02:35:42.620 --> 02:35:44.620
Spatial computing stop

02:35:45.660 --> 02:35:46.940
enough

02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:48.380
Anywho

02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:51.020
What I can't I can't tell you what it'll be for sure

02:35:51.020 --> 02:35:54.140
But what I can tell you is it won't be the we head

02:35:55.020 --> 02:35:57.020
Have you seen this thing luke?

02:35:57.260 --> 02:36:02.380
Uh, I have not watched this video, but I've had a bunch of people message me about it. I saw someone

02:36:02.860 --> 02:36:08.780
Uh, they sent me a photo of me on this thing in this seat

02:36:08.860 --> 02:36:13.260
They like photo edited it and they're like, this is how you have to like telecommute into wancho moving forward

02:36:13.260 --> 02:36:15.260
And I was like, what the heck are you talking about?

02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:19.660
What the heck it looks so weird?

02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:26.380
It's like someone like wanted to go into the uncanny valley and just make something that's uncomfortable to look at

02:36:28.620 --> 02:36:31.740
Like intentionally hold on we've got me on it later

02:36:33.340 --> 02:36:35.340
um

02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:38.060
Where is it?

02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:43.900
Oh my goodness. No, we've got jake delavance. Yeah, this is amazing. Like it just it looks so bad

02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:46.540
He can nod

02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:52.700
Like what the heck? Oh my goodness. I feel like it wants to eat me like yeah

02:36:53.740 --> 02:36:57.100
I am powered by human meat. Um anywho

02:36:58.220 --> 02:37:03.420
Yeah, it's not the we head. I think it's gonna it's it's gotta be displays bolted to your face and

02:37:04.700 --> 02:37:07.820
Whether that gets broadly accepted or not

02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:13.180
That I don't know but it's the direction everyone's kind of trying to go right now

02:37:16.620 --> 02:37:18.620
I want to go in the direction of another topic

02:37:20.300 --> 02:37:25.900
What do you want to talk about Lou? I'm responding to a merge message, but I will pause that and jump over. Um

02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:32.220
We kind of talked about dpr review living on last week. Did we uh, you mentioned it

02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:35.100
I don't think we really talked about it, but you know, I don't think I did

02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:40.300
Did you just mention it to me off the wancho? No, I said I know I said it was like gone. I didn't know this

02:37:41.020 --> 02:37:43.740
Oh, what how did I know this then? I don't know, but this is amazing

02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:45.820
DP review

02:37:45.820 --> 02:37:52.060
The digital photography review website was supposed to seize publishing in april as part of mass layoffs at amazon

02:37:52.140 --> 02:37:59.740
However, the site continued publishing over the intervening months and apparently it's been abot by gear patrol an independent tech review site

02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:02.780
Uh, they officially acquired them as of this week

02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:07.500
DP reviews editor in chief released a statement saying that the site will continue to operate as it did before

02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:13.020
With all editorial coverage and site features remaining the same and all historical content accessible

02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:18.620
This is amazing for photography nerds and gearheads and well, those are synonyms

02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:22.220
Whatever the point is dp reviews current staff will keep working though

02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:27.580
It does not appear that employees that left due to the announced closure have been invited to resume their positions

02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:34.140
Former site editor ganon bergett responded to the news by saying he was happy for his former colleagues and for the preservation of the site

02:38:34.140 --> 02:38:37.980
Me too, but was also critical of amazon handling of the situation

02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:42.540
Uh, you should figure this sort of stuff out before shutting down an entire division of the company

02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:48.860
Not in hindsight after weeks of backlash and leaving freelancers to scramble for new gigs agree 100 percent

02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:53.020
This was just meant to be a small update, but i'm super happy to see this

02:38:53.740 --> 02:38:56.940
People are saying I thought you were going to buy them. No, I I have to confess

02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:01.580
I just saw the way that amazon unceremoniously announced that it would be shut down

02:39:01.660 --> 02:39:04.700
And I assumed they weren't interested in an acquisition and I didn't even reach out

02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:08.220
yeah, it's something I could have potentially been interested in but

02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:14.620
The opportunity never presented itself because I didn't think to pursue it. I just was like, no, well, it's dead

02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:17.340
um

02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:19.820
That sucks

02:39:20.140 --> 02:39:26.300
Meanwhile the ftc sues amazon for tricking customers into prime subscriptions

02:39:27.180 --> 02:39:29.260
Can you get tricked into a prime subscription?

02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:35.820
Um, sort of actually I will defend that a little bit. We're going to talk about dark patterns. Are we yes?

02:39:35.980 --> 02:39:39.820
All right, luke's going to talk about dark patterns. So dark patterns snack

02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:43.420
Okay

02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:49.900
He wants to get it himself dan. Okay, uh, so a dark pattern is a confusing or misleading

02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:57.820
Uh user experience that leads you to do a thing that the company wants you to do and not a thing that you want to do

02:39:58.220 --> 02:39:59.420
um

02:39:59.420 --> 02:40:03.820
Prime subscriptions are oh wow. We're doing this. Hey, how's it going?

02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:05.820
This feels a lot more intimate for some reason

02:40:06.220 --> 02:40:11.980
Prime subscriptions are known for this because of how persistent they are in trying to get you to sign up for it

02:40:12.220 --> 02:40:14.220
And by offering free sign up

02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:15.580
at the beginning

02:40:15.580 --> 02:40:21.900
But the worst part in my opinion is that it is ridiculously hard to cancel

02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:25.100
um, and that

02:40:26.220 --> 02:40:28.220
I don't know why this is a thing

02:40:29.420 --> 02:40:31.420
But I know a surprising amount of

02:40:32.060 --> 02:40:38.140
Old people, uh, who end up with multiple of them, right like a lot of people. I don't know why

02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:41.260
But it's been a thing

02:40:41.900 --> 02:40:47.340
I have I genuinely no idea why that one. I genuinely don't understand. I will say this

02:40:47.980 --> 02:40:54.700
I know a surprising number of they call it dark patterns. Yeah, that's what lana said older relatives that, um

02:40:55.820 --> 02:40:57.820
Have more than one email address

02:40:58.780 --> 02:41:01.740
Because they use their isp-provided one

02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:05.980
Which I would say is a dark pattern in and of itself sort of

02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:13.260
In that it's a way to lock you into using this particular isp forever and

02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:18.300
Has no benefit whatsoever as far as I can tell

02:41:19.340 --> 02:41:24.140
Anyway, so they will often have an isp email address because I don't know

02:41:24.140 --> 02:41:29.260
They think they're supposed to use it or something and then they will also have a not stupid one

02:41:30.060 --> 02:41:32.700
Um, whether it's like an outlook or gmail or like

02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:37.740
Proton mail, I don't know. It doesn't matter the point. I don't know any older people with a proton mail account, but

02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:41.820
The point is um, they'll often have more than one

02:41:42.540 --> 02:41:44.540
So maybe that's part of how they end up

02:41:45.180 --> 02:41:47.900
With multiple prime accounts as they just like have these random

02:41:48.460 --> 02:41:49.740
email accounts

02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:51.740
I know some of them too

02:41:52.380 --> 02:41:59.020
And this is more of a thing for canadiens because like 80 of us live within what is it 50 kilometers of the border or something like that?

02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:01.500
um, but

02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:05.820
A fair amount of it is the confusing way that amazon deals with

02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:08.620
different countries

02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:10.940
Because you can like have the same

02:42:12.540 --> 02:42:14.540
login

02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:20.300
But also not no, yeah, creating multiple accounts. Yep, and you can have a prime for both countries

02:42:20.940 --> 02:42:22.940
But it's not necessary

02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:26.700
And like I didn't even know I don't think it is. I don't know. I don't actually use amazon

02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:34.780
Well your prime for it's definitely not necessary if you are an american because everything that's on the canadian one is going to be on the american one

02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:36.620
So you should just use the american one

02:42:36.620 --> 02:42:42.140
Yeah, I just don't think there's a benefit to prime if you are canadian anyway because they're not going to ship for free to canada

02:42:42.220 --> 02:42:46.460
So from the american one. Yeah, yeah, I don't know but like I I

02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:49.260
Don't know I don't get it

02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:50.300
I don't use amazon

02:42:50.300 --> 02:42:55.340
But I do know a lot of people that end up getting really screwed over and have a bunch of prime accounts and yeah

02:42:55.500 --> 02:42:58.700
People in shatter people in shatter pitching in yeah

02:42:58.700 --> 02:43:04.300
I live in the eu and I have an eu account, but I accidentally have a us account for audible and prime

02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:05.820
Yep

02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:11.180
Yeah, I I had a hard time remembering which email I had signed up for um kindle unlimited

02:43:12.380 --> 02:43:13.260
which

02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:15.260
Good service. I like it, but

02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:22.620
I it took me like four times logging in to figure out which one and if I if I didn't remember that I definitely freaking had one

02:43:23.580 --> 02:43:28.860
It I could have I could have accidentally signed up for another one. Yeah. Yeah, I could see that

02:43:29.580 --> 02:43:32.940
I mean, that's how we're going to achieve limitless growth with capitalism

02:43:33.900 --> 02:43:38.380
Instead of instead of having every customer once we'll have every customer twice

02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:41.820
This is the way

02:43:42.540 --> 02:43:44.540
That's amazing

02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:48.860
Anyway, did we actually talk about the the ftc thing yet?

02:43:49.660 --> 02:43:52.140
No, okay, cool. Wait, what ftc thing?

02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:59.340
They sued amazon on wednesday for making it easy to accidentally subscribe to their prime service with a labyrinthian

02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:07.420
process to cancel the lawsuit actually what the lawsuit alleges that amazon knowingly tricked millions of americans into signing up for their prime

02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:13.180
Subscription using manipulative coercive or deceptive user interface designs. So these are dark patterns

02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:17.820
Did you know this was in the dark? I had no idea this was in the dark. I left you here to do this topic

02:44:18.060 --> 02:44:20.060
And then there were no snacks

02:44:20.060 --> 02:44:22.780
So now i'm doubly angry. Wait, there are snacks. They're in the kitchen

02:44:23.580 --> 02:44:25.580
There are snacks in the kitchen. Oh

02:44:25.580 --> 02:44:26.540
all right

02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:30.860
The ftc said amazon prompted customers to subscribe to prime

02:44:31.580 --> 02:44:36.140
Repeatedly and made it hard to find the button to proceed without subscription during checkout

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:40.620
That's how people could end up with a bunch of these because if they just happen to be browsing the site

02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:44.460
And they just happen to enter a different email this time. Oh, I don't have it

02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:50.700
Likewise amazon purposefully made prime's cancel cancellation page difficult to find

02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:56.780
The cancellation process would then bombard customers with offers that are intended to change their mind over the course of several

02:44:57.180 --> 02:44:59.180
unnecessary cancellation steps

02:44:59.180 --> 02:45:03.740
according to the lawsuit this lengthy cancellation process was known internally as

02:45:04.220 --> 02:45:10.540
The iliad after the 15 hour epic poem that recounts the events of the trojan war

02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:18.300
According to the commission the primary purpose of the prime cancellation process was not to enable subscribers to cancel

02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:20.540
But rather to thwart them

02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:25.740
amazon has said these claims are false on the facts and the law and that by design

02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:30.060
We make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for and cancel their prime out. It is better now

02:45:30.540 --> 02:45:37.260
It was really bad for a bit. I remember this. I remember when I had to cancel my my grandfather's after he passed away

02:45:37.740 --> 02:45:39.740
I remember being legitimately like

02:45:41.260 --> 02:45:46.620
Needing to actually focus because I was like it's really really trying to get me to press the wrong button here

02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:50.700
And I had to press the right button many times and they would switch what side it was on

02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:54.060
And they would change which one was highlighted and they would do all these little things

02:45:54.060 --> 02:45:56.620
So you had to like really make sure and they would change it would be like

02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:59.500
No, I do want to cancel

02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:06.620
Or it would be like or they would they would switch which one said no and why and like all it was very very

02:46:06.780 --> 02:46:11.580
Okay, well, maybe I remember wrong. Okay, this was a while ago. This was a while ago. Well, it wasn't that long ago

02:46:11.740 --> 02:46:14.460
I was thinking a whileer ago. Okay. Yeah, like

02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:19.820
So I haven't tried that recently now that I think about it. I just I thought I had to cancel one

02:46:20.140 --> 02:46:22.380
A little while ago and it wasn't that bad. I don't know guys

02:46:22.540 --> 02:46:27.100
It's like if if you're if you're someone who's expecting these things. It's fine. You can get through it

02:46:27.580 --> 02:46:31.580
But the main thing that was standing out to me was like no wonder my grandpa couldn't cancel this

02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:35.420
There's like there's no way it would have been such a mess

02:46:36.460 --> 02:46:38.460
Yeah, I don't know

02:46:38.780 --> 02:46:43.580
If you have to call someone about tech support problems, they're like not going to be able to cancel

02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:48.380
Okay, this might be a hard conversation, but your grandpa was pretty with it. He was like when I

02:46:49.340 --> 02:46:51.900
met him, which wasn't that long ago like

02:46:52.540 --> 02:47:01.260
And he was actually decently like technical and stuff. Yeah, but it was a crazy loop of long forms

02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:04.940
Is this like a cultural thing almost like when he was young

02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:10.460
Was it just simple to cancel a service? And so he's just like not used to this gauntlet, you know

02:47:10.540 --> 02:47:13.100
you would have had to like call the the the

02:47:14.380 --> 02:47:16.300
listicle company

02:47:16.300 --> 02:47:20.220
The list they didn't have computers. Did you just say listicle? You mean a switchboard?

02:47:20.860 --> 02:47:22.860
No, because they made like

02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:25.740
Listicle newsletters and also

02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:33.020
Zines and also magazines. You mean zines magazines zines. What the hell is a zine zines are a thing

02:47:33.180 --> 02:47:36.540
What is a zine a zine? Okay. Do you guys know what he's talking about?

02:47:37.100 --> 02:47:43.740
Is he intentionally using gen z slang? No, I'm not I'm intentionally using really old school stuff a zine is a

02:47:44.380 --> 02:47:46.380
most commonly

02:47:46.540 --> 02:47:49.340
This is a weird way of saying this a zine is a most commonly

02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:52.460
I'm adding the word a because I'm really dyslexic

02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:59.340
A zine is most commonly a small circulation publication of original or appropriated text and images more broadly

02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:06.220
The term encompasses any self-published unique work of minority interest usually reproduced via photocopier

02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:12.620
I'm pretty sure it's zine. I think it's like short for magazine like a short small magazine. You are correct

02:48:13.180 --> 02:48:18.060
Okay zine. I don't okay good to know I have a hundred percent heard it called zine

02:48:18.380 --> 02:48:24.540
Well, maybe they were all so wrong. Maybe they couldn't figure out how to cancel an amazon subscription

02:48:29.660 --> 02:48:32.140
Oh, no luke any who

02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:33.900
um

02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:35.660
Here's what I want to know

02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:39.260
Where does the line fall and I'm not saying what amazon's doing is okay

02:48:39.340 --> 02:48:44.700
It's like definitely not okay if I want to unsubscribe from a mailing list if I want to cancel a subscription

02:48:45.180 --> 02:48:47.420
It should be one button at most two

02:48:48.060 --> 02:48:51.980
And are you sure is fine anything more than that unacceptable

02:48:52.780 --> 02:48:58.460
But where is the line like should a cable company be allowed to even have a retention department?

02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:03.420
You know like is it okay to give me an offer is the offer okay?

02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:07.340
Hey, uh, keep it and we'll give you the next two months for free like is that okay?

02:49:07.580 --> 02:49:11.820
And like how what is okay? Yeah, it's like open negotiation is no longer allowed

02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:15.820
How many times should I be allowed to say it's how many times should I have to say no? I'm not interested

02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:17.340
I want to cancel

02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:19.340
Is is is once

02:49:19.980 --> 02:49:24.860
Enough and they shouldn't be allowed to say or do anything. It's twice. I mean twice is probably fine. You know

02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:31.740
Are you sure? Yes. What if I offer you this? Well now it's three times. Is that too many? What what's the line you guys?

02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:33.420
Yeah

02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:36.620
Because I think this is almost a uniquely like internet problem

02:49:37.900 --> 02:49:44.940
Because if you called in I mean try to try to get out of a car salesman's office once they've like pulled you into the office

02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:49.260
I think this is absolutely an in person. I've just literally just got up and left. Yeah, but you're rude

02:49:52.860 --> 02:49:54.380
Yeah, but

02:49:54.380 --> 02:49:58.700
What I'm saying is like if you don't want to buy that car you can actually just physically remove yourself

02:49:58.780 --> 02:50:01.980
You can if if you they're trying to keep you from doing for sure

02:50:02.300 --> 02:50:05.500
If you call in to something and you say I want to cancel

02:50:06.060 --> 02:50:09.180
This is my details. I want to cancel and they're like, oh, I'm gonna counter offer you

02:50:09.420 --> 02:50:13.500
You should be able to say no, I don't care. I want to cancel. Goodbye and it should be done

02:50:14.060 --> 02:50:15.580
um

02:50:15.580 --> 02:50:17.580
But I mean it likely won't be I guess

02:50:18.380 --> 02:50:20.060
um

02:50:20.060 --> 02:50:24.300
Yeah, and I guess the difference is that in the car scenario

02:50:25.740 --> 02:50:30.620
You're the one they need something from you. Not the other way around. Yeah with the cancellation

02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:34.540
I need something from them. So I can't simply disengage from this

02:50:35.180 --> 02:50:39.580
Interaction. I have to see it through. So what would be a more fair?

02:50:40.540 --> 02:50:43.660
I I like the idea of having a third button

02:50:44.380 --> 02:50:48.220
Um, I don't know if this is enforceable or not, but having a third button. That's just like

02:50:48.940 --> 02:50:51.660
I genuinely do not care. You could offer me the moon

02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:54.300
cancel it. Hmm

02:50:54.620 --> 02:50:56.300
moon cancel

02:50:56.300 --> 02:50:59.180
No, I'm pretty sure I'm still not interested or like

02:50:59.900 --> 02:51:01.740
Definitely. No

02:51:01.740 --> 02:51:03.500
Okay, okay

02:51:03.500 --> 02:51:05.500
Interesting

02:51:06.220 --> 02:51:08.540
Just cancel to the moon

02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:16.060
Oh, man, just don't get as canceled as under the sea might get you

02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:21.580
Moon's okay

02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:28.620
Dad's dad's trying to move us on

02:51:29.500 --> 02:51:31.500
That's probably for the best

02:51:31.580 --> 02:51:32.780
AMD

02:51:32.780 --> 02:51:39.740
Appears to restrict DLSS support in sponsored AAA titles. This is a weird one. I don't think it's confirmed right now

02:51:39.740 --> 02:51:41.740
It's more just scuttle butt

02:51:42.380 --> 02:51:49.660
But since the release of both Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FSR a pattern seems to have emerged

02:51:50.140 --> 02:51:55.980
First that DLSS has been adopted at a far faster pace in part due to the friendlier tools and ease of use and second

02:51:56.380 --> 02:52:03.900
That AAA titles sponsored by AMD are far less likely to get DLSS support than the other way around

02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:09.660
AMD gave a broad statement pointing out that there are some games with DLSS support

02:52:09.660 --> 02:52:12.220
But no FSR support and saying that they are

02:52:12.620 --> 02:52:15.900
Committed to doing what is best for game developers and gamers

02:52:16.300 --> 02:52:21.020
And that they give developers the flexibility to implement FSR into whatever games they choose

02:52:21.420 --> 02:52:27.660
But Nvidia was quite a bit more specific saying Nvidia does not and will not block restrict discourage or hinder developers from

02:52:27.740 --> 02:52:30.220
Implementing competitor technologies in any way

02:52:30.780 --> 02:52:34.300
We provide support and tools for all game developers to easily integrate DLSS

02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:40.060
If they choose and even created Nvidia's streamline to make it easier for game developers to add competitive technologies to their games

02:52:40.540 --> 02:52:44.700
And you know, that's all a lot of like sort of corporate bull speak, but

02:52:45.660 --> 02:52:48.220
The games list kind of um

02:52:49.180 --> 02:52:54.380
Speaks for itself. It really does actually so we've got bundle partner Nvidia. We've got

02:52:55.420 --> 02:52:57.420
almost across the

02:52:57.500 --> 02:53:05.260
Board there are some that are AMD that has both. Yeah, and there are there's one from Nvidia that does not support FSR

02:53:06.300 --> 02:53:11.180
Um, but the vast majority of the AMD bundle partner games

02:53:11.660 --> 02:53:17.180
Do not support DLSS in spite of some of them being like unreal engine games that

02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:23.500
Probably could support it pretty easily. How does world of warcraft not support either of these things?

02:53:23.660 --> 02:53:27.980
Why is it even on here if it doesn't support? Oh, because it's AMD. Yeah build burners

02:53:28.780 --> 02:53:30.780
um

02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:34.220
I don't know what to say about this

02:53:36.220 --> 02:53:38.220
Other than hmm

02:53:38.700 --> 02:53:39.900
I don't

02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:45.740
Like it. We should have we should have the option to choose what upscaling technology we want to use

02:53:46.700 --> 02:53:49.100
Um, is there some pattern in like?

02:53:54.540 --> 02:53:57.180
The reddit thing is continuing in other news

02:53:57.580 --> 02:54:03.180
Uh, yeah, a bunch of subreddits set themselves to not safe for work friendly and loosened their

02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:05.980
not safe for work

02:54:05.980 --> 02:54:10.380
Uh guidelines around sexual content. Uh, this was to

02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:18.700
Supposedly like reduce reddit's ability to target ads at the users in these subreddits and monetize those users

02:54:19.260 --> 02:54:26.300
And an apparent crackdown a number of monitors from subreddits that recently set to not safe for work were removed and locked out of their accounts

02:54:27.020 --> 02:54:30.940
Several forums with over a million members are now completely unmoderated. Um

02:54:31.980 --> 02:54:38.300
Reddit has refused to comment beyond saying that it is not acceptable for moderators to falsely label content as nsfw

02:54:38.380 --> 02:54:43.260
Or encourage nsfw content in previously safe for work spaces. This next point is my favorite

02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:49.980
Meanwhile other subreddits such as r slash political humor have voted to make all members moderators in response to reddit's

02:54:50.140 --> 02:54:56.060
CEO steve huffman calling moderators landed gentry that ignore the desires of rank and file users

02:54:57.020 --> 02:54:59.020
everyone

02:54:59.580 --> 02:55:01.980
Oh, that's amazing when everyone's a monitor

02:55:02.540 --> 02:55:07.580
A monitor and when everyone's a moderator, no one will be know it's pronounced zine Linus

02:55:08.060 --> 02:55:10.060
um

02:55:10.940 --> 02:55:16.220
Yeah, I don't know the last topic we absolutely must do before we get into when show after dark. Yes

02:55:16.780 --> 02:55:18.060
eve online

02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:23.740
Uh, yes now has native support for microsoft excel

02:55:24.460 --> 02:55:30.700
Tell me about how tell me how this makes you feel. It's actually awesome. Um, you don't even have to pay for it

02:55:31.180 --> 02:55:34.780
It's a free plugin for the game. It's so sweet

02:55:35.260 --> 02:55:38.540
Eve online. Yeah, it's just great. I don't know if you don't know anything about eve

02:55:38.540 --> 02:55:43.260
It might not make a lot of sense. You can absolutely play eve without ever touching a spreadsheet

02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:47.260
Uh, but many people that do play eve do a lot of things in the game

02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:51.020
Especially if you're an economy player, which is a lot of the people that play eve

02:55:51.500 --> 02:55:54.780
Um, that are I mean you're gonna do better if you use your spreadsheets

02:55:55.660 --> 02:55:56.940
so

02:55:56.940 --> 02:56:04.300
So players will be able to create custom reports graphs and charts to organize and derive insights from their in-game

02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:08.780
Data eve online players were reportedly thrilled when the partnership was announced

02:56:08.860 --> 02:56:12.620
As many of them were already using excel to manage in-game information

02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:17.260
Discussion question is an eve online subscription now a valid work expense

02:56:19.500 --> 02:56:20.700
No

02:56:20.700 --> 02:56:23.180
Hey, why not? No jessica. It's not

02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:29.740
Eve has often been called a spreadsheet simulator. So now do we just call it a spreadsheet?

02:56:30.700 --> 02:56:32.700
I guess so

02:56:33.260 --> 02:56:34.860
And now do we call this

02:56:34.860 --> 02:56:38.780
Wancho after dark? I think so. I think we do. I think we have to because we're running out of time

02:56:38.860 --> 02:56:41.420
Best selling item today mystery 40 ounce water bottle

02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:44.300
I'm into it. Oh Dan's on it

02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:48.380
Okay, I'm going top to bottom

02:56:48.620 --> 02:56:50.620
um

02:56:51.180 --> 02:56:53.340
Oh, wow, there's still a lot of merge messages Dan

02:56:54.060 --> 02:56:56.060
Why are your fingers not on fire more?

02:56:56.860 --> 02:56:58.860
From type piping faster

02:57:00.700 --> 02:57:02.700
Okay, let's see. Where are we?

02:57:03.580 --> 02:57:09.900
Hi DLL. It's is it more beneficial to be a jack of all trades in the world of tech or a master of one

02:57:10.300 --> 02:57:15.420
Thanks guys. I love everything you do man. Both of them both are both are good both

02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:22.300
I mean, why not both? Yeah. Well, no no seriously though like being a special. Okay. We talked about this a while back

02:57:22.700 --> 02:57:26.140
Uh, man, it was like super super old

02:57:26.380 --> 02:57:31.180
Someone asked they they were only familiar with like this like really old programming language or something

02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:35.900
Yeah, something like that and they were like, hey, what can I do to modernize my credentials?

02:57:36.220 --> 02:57:42.060
And I think luke gave really good advice there because being a specialist in a niche is

02:57:43.180 --> 02:57:45.180
Absolutely valuable. In fact

02:57:45.260 --> 02:57:51.820
It's it's going to be like a bathtub shaped curve here, right? So the more the more generalized you are

02:57:52.540 --> 02:57:56.220
The more valuable you become because all of a sudden you have

02:57:56.940 --> 02:58:02.700
Insight and you have context some new technology comes out and you can automatically be on it to pull together

02:58:03.100 --> 02:58:08.140
Well, I'm thinking from like a management standpoint even though like to pull together disparate teams and

02:58:08.780 --> 02:58:12.620
Turn all the things that they're working on into a single cohesive product like that is

02:58:13.260 --> 02:58:17.980
Super valuable. That's how you succeed in business, right? But then over on the and then you've got people that are like

02:58:18.940 --> 02:58:22.300
Pretty good at a few things and it's like, okay, right

02:58:22.300 --> 02:58:25.980
But your experience is too narrow and you're not really a subject matter expert

02:58:27.660 --> 02:58:32.380
And then you've got people who are like super uber specialists at like

02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:39.980
Animal recognition machine vision stuff or something. I don't know. I'm picking something completely out of thin air here

02:58:40.300 --> 02:58:42.300
Because my point is just that

02:58:42.860 --> 02:58:44.860
to the right customer

02:58:45.180 --> 02:58:47.980
If you are the freaking best at that

02:58:48.700 --> 02:58:52.620
Leaks basically you've write your own check, right? Like you just you just tell them how much it costs

02:58:52.620 --> 02:58:54.620
And if they want the best implementation

02:58:54.860 --> 02:58:57.820
Well, then they have to hire you and that that's all that's kind of all there is to it

02:58:57.820 --> 02:59:01.020
I would say I would say both are good. Um, but

02:59:01.820 --> 02:59:06.860
Pick one don't land in the middle if you can avoid it. Yeah, like I specifically mentioned cobalt

02:59:06.860 --> 02:59:09.580
I don't know if this is the one that the person was skilled in

02:59:10.220 --> 02:59:12.220
But I just googled it because I was wondering

02:59:12.780 --> 02:59:18.140
And there's a statement here that's it's difficult to make it through a day without using a system that depends on cobalt

02:59:18.300 --> 02:59:22.460
And you're like what most people have never even heard of this and it's like, yeah a lot of banks

02:59:23.420 --> 02:59:28.700
Run on systems developed rain maker and twitch chat says if you're a cobalt master apply it places like micron

02:59:28.780 --> 02:59:30.780
They still use it and you make silly money

02:59:30.860 --> 02:59:35.580
You make ridiculous money because no one coming out of school is like, oh, I'm gonna go learn cobalt

02:59:35.740 --> 02:59:41.420
So the amount of people that are still in the workforce that know it is only going down dropping. Yeah

02:59:41.740 --> 02:59:45.900
Yep, so like yeah, whatever and there's always going to be legacy stuff like

02:59:46.540 --> 02:59:52.380
Until I don't even know if they've updated it. Isn't the nuclear football like using technology from like 1960 or something

02:59:52.380 --> 02:59:55.820
Yeah, I remember hearing something about that. Yeah, maybe it's been updated now

02:59:55.900 --> 03:00:01.180
But you'd be amazed at what kind of tech they're running in like a nuclear silo for example

03:00:01.180 --> 03:00:07.260
I was talking to the floppy distance stuff the folks that um a data recovery company that we worked with a while back

03:00:07.260 --> 03:00:08.780
We're saying like

03:00:08.780 --> 03:00:10.780
You would be surprised

03:00:11.260 --> 03:00:15.820
the kinds of hard drives that we're expected to not just

03:00:16.540 --> 03:00:18.540
recover data from sometimes

03:00:19.020 --> 03:00:25.980
But also maintain a working stock of replacements for because of the kind of organizations and the kind of money

03:00:26.060 --> 03:00:29.500
They have to keep this ancient machinery running yet. You'd be

03:00:30.300 --> 03:00:31.260
amazed

03:00:31.260 --> 03:00:33.260
I don't know how old this article is. Yeah

03:00:33.900 --> 03:00:35.900
Oh 2019

03:00:36.140 --> 03:00:42.620
It was revealed in the event that if the u.s. President ordered the launch of a nuclear warhead the command would rely on an

03:00:42.780 --> 03:00:44.780
eight inch floppy disk

03:00:45.580 --> 03:00:47.580
Or a series of them at least

03:00:47.740 --> 03:00:49.740
Wow, yeah

03:00:49.980 --> 03:00:57.900
Good grave. Those are the old school ones and we're talking floppy disks. I told my wife. This is eight inches, but it's actually more like this

03:00:59.100 --> 03:01:00.860
That's a lot

03:01:00.860 --> 03:01:02.860
Yeah, yeah, so like

03:01:03.740 --> 03:01:05.340
Yeah, I don't know

03:01:05.340 --> 03:01:11.260
Not saying that modernizing is a bad thing either. I'm just saying you don't have to you can try to find a niche where you're at

03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:14.460
Yeah

03:01:14.460 --> 03:01:20.060
And no, I am not necessarily recommending that you person in university right now learning

03:01:20.380 --> 03:01:26.540
Programming languages should just drop everything and learn kobol. That is not that wasn't the point. It's not the point

03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:31.100
Yeah, another one

03:01:32.860 --> 03:01:40.140
Yeah, what are some more obscure innovations that might have succeeded if they had been open or standardized or regulated?

03:01:40.220 --> 03:01:46.300
Instead of proprietary daisy chainable rgb fans rgb and backside mobo connections come to mind

03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:52.060
Hmm obscure innovations that might have succeeded if they'd been more

03:01:53.020 --> 03:01:55.020
Open and less proprietary

03:01:55.020 --> 03:01:57.020
I don't I

03:01:57.420 --> 03:02:00.620
I mean, okay memory stick kind of comes to mind

03:02:01.100 --> 03:02:02.220
um

03:02:02.220 --> 03:02:04.220
if sony hadn't

03:02:04.460 --> 03:02:10.540
Been such a if sony hadn't built such a such a closed ecosystem around their flash memory standard

03:02:11.260 --> 03:02:13.980
Maybe it could have been more broadly successful, but

03:02:14.780 --> 03:02:18.860
I feel like the spirit of your question was almost like a product

03:02:19.500 --> 03:02:23.980
category like portable flash memory absolutely did succeed

03:02:24.460 --> 03:02:29.020
Because the open standard ultimately won right so we ended up with you know sd

03:02:29.580 --> 03:02:31.180
um

03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:33.180
So if what you're asking is

03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:40.700
Man, I I think we could have seen a lot more innovation in and this is just speaking from my personal experience

03:02:40.700 --> 03:02:48.220
I think we could have seen a lot more innovation in production equipment a lot faster if the standards were more open and intercompatible

03:02:48.780 --> 03:02:53.660
um, you know, every everything from red proprietary media to the

03:02:54.380 --> 03:02:56.620
proprietary controller boxes for

03:02:57.180 --> 03:03:01.340
Studio lighting equipment there are more standardized ones

03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:07.020
But what's funny is a lot of the time they're even more expensive or not open source and free

03:03:07.580 --> 03:03:08.860
um

03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:15.180
Like dmx comes to mind for controlling uh for controlling lighting. That's like more baller

03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:21.500
Um to have that kind of interoperability as opposed to more affordable using, you know commodity hardware

03:03:21.900 --> 03:03:26.540
Kind of like what we would what we would imagine the more it open standard to be right

03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:29.900
um

03:03:29.980 --> 03:03:31.980
Can you think of anything?

03:03:32.380 --> 03:03:38.380
Uh, I've been responding. It was locked in proprietary vill and would have been more successful if it had been more open

03:03:40.540 --> 03:03:42.540
There's a lot of things that are

03:03:42.780 --> 03:03:45.180
vampirically successful due to not being open

03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:47.740
Uh, which is unfortunate

03:03:47.900 --> 03:03:50.380
Well things would be more successful due to being open

03:03:52.460 --> 03:03:54.940
Would we have seen would we have seen

03:03:56.380 --> 03:04:00.940
No, there's a lot of games that I I feel like you could talk about about this like I think they

03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:03.100
Oh by being more modding friendly

03:04:03.180 --> 03:04:03.980
and

03:04:03.980 --> 03:04:10.140
Man, the fact that a game developer would look at the industry and the history of gaming and go

03:04:11.260 --> 03:04:17.980
You know what fucking sucks mods mods are terrible when gamers mod the fucking game. I hate that

03:04:18.060 --> 03:04:24.460
That's a recipe for fucking failure. Can you imagine being that stupid? Yeah, that's pretty brutal. Yeah

03:04:25.740 --> 03:04:27.740
What are you talking about?

03:04:28.620 --> 03:04:30.620
Players enhancing the experience is

03:04:31.660 --> 03:04:38.060
What has kept games alive and relevant for years past their best before date think about it like I

03:04:38.780 --> 03:04:44.620
I would argue. I don't know if I would be right. I'm not that in tune with things, but I would argue that we're not exactly in a

03:04:45.580 --> 03:04:46.860
Ah

03:04:46.860 --> 03:04:48.860
Valorant's doing pretty well actually

03:04:49.260 --> 03:04:54.220
Just before valorant. I would say I would argue that we were we're not exactly in a golden age of shooters

03:04:55.580 --> 03:04:56.620
Hmm

03:04:56.620 --> 03:05:00.620
Sure valorant's kind of popping off though, but valorant's really just like modern counter strike

03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:05.340
Like I still don't really think we are and one of my arguments. I think would be the

03:05:07.420 --> 03:05:09.420
Departure of dedicated servers

03:05:09.980 --> 03:05:13.980
Yeah, because if you think back when like counter strike was so many different experiences

03:05:14.140 --> 03:05:19.260
You could play like warcraft versions of counter strike where you would like level up and all this weird like it was

03:05:20.060 --> 03:05:25.340
And a lot of the a lot of the innovative game modes that you play in modern shooters like gun game

03:05:25.660 --> 03:05:29.420
Gun game was just it's a mod. Yeah, right like yeah

03:05:30.220 --> 03:05:34.300
So like uh, yeah, I feel like that's a big part of the reason why is a lot of the modding right now

03:05:34.300 --> 03:05:37.420
Is in like the rpg space or the single player space

03:05:37.820 --> 03:05:42.460
But dedicated servers used to have very very interesting versions of first person shooter games

03:05:42.700 --> 03:05:45.740
And first person shooter games don't have dedicated servers anymore

03:05:45.820 --> 03:05:49.340
So we lost this modding support in an indirect way, but it still happened

03:05:49.980 --> 03:05:53.660
Yeah, that's a really good point. I didn't really think about that before I feel like that's it

03:05:55.100 --> 03:05:59.420
Yeah, kataz is saying I miss starcraft 1 and 2 custom games 100 percent

03:06:04.940 --> 03:06:07.580
Original cs was a half-life mod. Yeah, that's a good point

03:06:07.660 --> 03:06:14.940
Yeah, well, don't forget original dota 2 was a warcraft 3 mod like a lot of the gaming experiences that we have today are because

03:06:15.340 --> 03:06:17.340
Of modded custom games

03:06:17.820 --> 03:06:21.180
Oni hi kid jover and float plane says you don't understand linus

03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:24.620
If you're still enjoying the old game, you're not going to buy the new one

03:06:25.660 --> 03:06:27.500
With all the horse armor

03:06:27.500 --> 03:06:29.500
I added the last part

03:06:30.060 --> 03:06:31.580
Yeah, I don't know

03:06:31.580 --> 03:06:36.460
All right hit me dan. Hi dll sloth here. I used to moderate a lot of subreddits

03:06:36.460 --> 03:06:42.060
But recently reddit has started threatening to remove us over the protest. What would you do as reddit ceo?

03:06:43.660 --> 03:06:50.220
Um, so I curated this one because I think it's I think it's interesting because there's kind of two ways to read it

03:06:51.340 --> 03:06:53.740
It's like what would you do if you were reddit ceo?

03:06:54.380 --> 03:06:56.220
or

03:06:56.220 --> 03:06:58.220
What would you do better?

03:06:58.460 --> 03:07:00.460
If you were actually him

03:07:01.340 --> 03:07:06.780
It's tough. See I don't have access to reddit's books. I have no idea how deep in the red

03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:09.420
Did they are?

03:07:09.580 --> 03:07:14.380
We talked last week kind of about this right like it's very likely that they had to do something like this

03:07:14.620 --> 03:07:19.260
But I think they didn't know their audience very well. You should have used their audience a little bit

03:07:19.420 --> 03:07:22.700
I mean what they should have done was appealed to their audience exactly and said look

03:07:23.180 --> 03:07:28.620
Here's the situation if we want reddit to survive in the form that it is now

03:07:29.020 --> 03:07:32.780
We guys want to be able to access all the stuff you can allegedly like then

03:07:33.180 --> 03:07:38.540
um, here's what we have to do and while we understand that the particular api

03:07:39.340 --> 03:07:43.340
call load of these these these custom apps is

03:07:43.740 --> 03:07:44.940
um

03:07:44.940 --> 03:07:48.380
Not actually costing, you know this amount exactly

03:07:49.180 --> 03:07:54.380
There's a huge opportunity cost to them that we have to make up in order for us to

03:07:55.340 --> 03:07:57.820
Go ipo or something

03:07:57.820 --> 03:08:04.540
I don't know. That's where it kind of falls apart because well the whole problem is that the whole motivation for it is to go ipo

03:08:04.700 --> 03:08:07.660
And the whole reason that you go ipo is to cash out

03:08:09.180 --> 03:08:12.620
So they were never going to really be able to appeal to the users

03:08:12.700 --> 03:08:18.140
Which I guess is why they decided to just take a more adversarial approach. I'm not really sure thing to me is

03:08:18.940 --> 03:08:24.060
The reddit CEO has done an extremely bad job of being an adversary

03:08:24.860 --> 03:08:31.260
Why is he losing so hard? This is what I don't get. Yeah, he has the biggest megaphone and on the tallest podium

03:08:31.500 --> 03:08:34.460
Doesn't do it like all these subreddits going not safe for work and stuff

03:08:34.540 --> 03:08:38.380
Why are you even letting them do that if you're trying to be big adversary guy?

03:08:38.780 --> 03:08:44.060
You're just like it feels like he's motivated to look the worst he could possibly look

03:08:44.540 --> 03:08:47.740
And just sit in that space for as long as possible

03:08:48.140 --> 03:08:51.980
Yeah, it's kind of a funny thing right because it's not like okay

03:08:52.460 --> 03:08:56.460
I could see the reddit community behaving kind of like a hydra

03:08:56.940 --> 03:09:02.300
You know, oh, yeah, you you chop off one head and it just like they're shockingly coordinated

03:09:02.300 --> 03:09:05.500
But a big part of how they coordinate is through reddit so

03:09:06.860 --> 03:09:08.540
I could see

03:09:08.540 --> 03:09:14.620
The evolution just kind of their of their rebellion happening so fast that reddit would have no way to respond

03:09:15.660 --> 03:09:21.820
But it's not no it's pretty slow. It's happening so slowly because his reactions are so slow

03:09:22.300 --> 03:09:28.540
And slow. It's it's so it's just weird. I don't know like I don't want people to think I'm I'm on spaz's side

03:09:28.540 --> 03:09:33.100
Because I'm absolutely not but it's been just hilarious to watch because I'm like, oh

03:09:33.580 --> 03:09:36.860
So the reddit moderators or people or whatever are doing this now

03:09:36.940 --> 03:09:41.420
I wonder what spaz is going to do about it and then just crickets for so long

03:09:41.820 --> 03:09:45.100
It's like, ah man if he wants to be like no, this is our platform

03:09:45.100 --> 03:09:50.620
We run it our way and then he's going to go around and remove certain moderators from certain subreddits and reopen

03:09:51.020 --> 03:09:55.020
Certain subreddits and force not safer work certain subreddits

03:09:55.100 --> 03:10:00.060
But doesn't do it with all of them and there's no real like logical pattern to how he's approaching any of this

03:10:00.380 --> 03:10:01.900
It's just like what

03:10:01.900 --> 03:10:06.300
What are you doing? I oh man. I don't know the whole thing is just so weird

03:10:07.260 --> 03:10:13.020
So so weird hot take the fact that you have a lot of money does not necessarily mean you were very smart

03:10:13.180 --> 03:10:15.980
Yeah, I think this like he's probably I don't know. Yeah

03:10:16.300 --> 03:10:20.300
I gotta stay away from like defamation, but things that could get me there think that

03:10:24.620 --> 03:10:26.540
Moving on

03:10:26.540 --> 03:10:32.300
Howdy ldl the escalating panic in dan's voice during the taiwan show stream crash was hysterical

03:10:32.860 --> 03:10:38.060
Question has there ever been an effort will do it live moment at ltt that turned out great

03:10:39.500 --> 03:10:44.940
Uh, has there ever been has there ever not been a f*** will do it live moment here? I mean

03:10:45.660 --> 03:10:47.420
That's a better way

03:10:47.420 --> 03:10:53.740
My my my personal, you know mantra is the show must go on the show must go on the show must go on

03:10:53.820 --> 03:11:00.860
So the number of oh my god like here tell you what that's probably what we're actually best at out of like everything

03:11:01.180 --> 03:11:05.500
Um, yeah, if I had a superpower it would be to take

03:11:06.540 --> 03:11:13.660
Absolute garbage and turn it into something that people might consider watching. I don't always succeed

03:11:14.380 --> 03:11:17.580
This tech toys one did not end up performing. Well, okay this

03:11:19.020 --> 03:11:23.340
This video I completely pulled out of my butt because we had no video for that week

03:11:23.340 --> 03:11:27.900
And I was like i'm gonna go on facebook marketplace. Oh 30 80s are cheap. Okay, sure

03:11:28.620 --> 03:11:30.540
um

03:11:30.540 --> 03:11:31.580
man

03:11:31.580 --> 03:11:37.660
This I pulled out of my butt and massive props to nerav for also pulling it out of his butt. It came out of both of our butts

03:11:38.940 --> 03:11:39.660
that

03:11:39.660 --> 03:11:46.300
Is sort of an unflattering description of the factory tour the point is we were supposed to go do something else and

03:11:46.620 --> 03:11:49.340
It bailed and we just did this instead

03:11:49.980 --> 03:11:51.420
um

03:11:51.420 --> 03:11:53.420
I literally didn't even know what this was

03:11:54.140 --> 03:12:00.620
When I opened it. So yeah, I think that's basically f*** it will do it live when i'm shooting this intro

03:12:00.780 --> 03:12:02.780
All I know is it's something

03:12:02.860 --> 03:12:04.860
Uh

03:12:05.100 --> 03:12:09.660
Oh, yeah, this facebook marketplace adventure is also f*** it will do it live

03:12:10.540 --> 03:12:12.540
uh

03:12:13.180 --> 03:12:15.180
Oh, man, this is great

03:12:15.820 --> 03:12:22.940
Uh, I'm trying to think let me see if I can find something that oh man. This was a hundred percent. Just forget it. We'll do it

03:12:24.540 --> 03:12:27.180
Well, I had no idea what I was walking into on this one

03:12:27.980 --> 03:12:33.900
I'm making it sound like we don't plan at all. We do we actually plan a lot. This took a lot of plan

03:12:33.980 --> 03:12:35.980
Hey, wait, where's the part two of this video?

03:12:36.940 --> 03:12:40.380
How the hell have we not released that yet? There's one where we actually like build the thing

03:12:40.780 --> 03:12:44.220
I thought you were talking about the amd challenge. Is this the building the one? No, there's that no

03:12:44.300 --> 03:12:48.140
There's a second part of this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah amd challenge

03:12:48.140 --> 03:12:52.700
Oh, man, this was one a hundred percent. We'll just do it live the water cooled my bed video

03:12:53.260 --> 03:12:57.980
That was awesome. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it did quite well. It was really good. Yeah. Yeah, that was that was a fun one

03:12:57.980 --> 03:12:59.980
I actually really enjoyed that

03:13:00.620 --> 03:13:08.060
Greetings from belgium when I started college. I chose biotech over it and I questioned that decision ever since

03:13:08.460 --> 03:13:11.580
What's the biggest life choice you had to make without knowing what you were doing?

03:13:13.260 --> 03:13:15.260
Oh dropping out of school

03:13:16.780 --> 03:13:20.700
Me too, but for different reasons. Yeah, that was pretty stupid

03:13:22.860 --> 03:13:28.460
Mine on paper was too. Yeah, I mean like no. Yeah, no, obviously mine on paper it ended up working out

03:13:28.460 --> 03:13:35.260
But like I could have easily never been promoted at ncix been working as like a sales guy and lost my job when they went under

03:13:36.620 --> 03:13:37.980
and then I'm

03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:39.100
in my

03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:44.620
What when so I'm in my mid 30s and my entire work experience is working as a computer salesman

03:13:44.620 --> 03:13:49.740
So basically what I apply at canada computers and I hope that they pay okay

03:13:49.820 --> 03:13:55.420
Yeah, that's unfortunate that could have easily been the plan

03:13:56.620 --> 03:13:57.820
and like

03:13:57.820 --> 03:14:07.500
No, no disrespect to people who work as a computer sales person, but it's um, I think my career trajectory has been more favorable than that

03:14:07.980 --> 03:14:09.980
since then so

03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:19.180
Like I am glad that I didn't go down with that ship. I did have better backup plans, but mine was still pretty yellow

03:14:19.740 --> 03:14:21.740
Is

03:14:23.340 --> 03:14:31.660
There any chance that we will get a wan show or introduction video with taren once he's had more time to acclimate to his new role within lmg

03:14:32.620 --> 03:14:34.620
Yes

03:14:34.700 --> 03:14:40.460
How many new channels do you have in the works now? I know you've got game linked and the react channel

03:14:40.700 --> 03:14:46.380
Any others I missed I'd love to speak a spin-off of short circuit for maker stuff like 3d printers

03:14:46.940 --> 03:14:50.780
You're going to see an expansion of sort of

03:14:51.580 --> 03:14:54.380
individual vertical focused channels like

03:14:55.020 --> 03:14:59.020
Focused on power supplies or headphones as the lab spins up their testing

03:14:59.100 --> 03:15:01.100
I think at some point in the future

03:15:01.100 --> 03:15:07.100
You will see like a more a hyper deep dive labs video channel

03:15:08.620 --> 03:15:13.340
I had completely forgotten about the react channel. So there you go. I guess that's where that's at

03:15:13.580 --> 03:15:17.500
Uh, game linked is coming soon. That'll be the one that is soonest

03:15:18.380 --> 03:15:21.180
And oh man, there was something else that I was going to talk about

03:15:22.460 --> 03:15:25.100
Yeah, that's everything that comes to mind right now

03:15:25.100 --> 03:15:29.260
I think we're going to be quite focused on more like vertical specific channels

03:15:29.260 --> 03:15:33.580
So that we can really focus on products that don't necessarily need to get 2 million views

03:15:34.060 --> 03:15:39.580
I think that sometime in the next six months to 18 months, you're going to see the ltt upload cadence change

03:15:40.060 --> 03:15:42.060
and that'll be for the first time in

03:15:43.340 --> 03:15:49.580
Almost 15 years. That's really funny to me. Every time I see people talk about how we're emphasizing quantity over quality these days

03:15:49.900 --> 03:15:52.700
And uploading too many videos the f*** you talking about

03:15:53.660 --> 03:16:00.780
The upload cadence actually hasn't changed in a decade and a half. You guys spend more time on individual videos than like ever

03:16:01.020 --> 03:16:03.260
Yeah, yeah, so I move to tell you

03:16:04.220 --> 03:16:06.060
So yeah, I think that

03:16:06.060 --> 03:16:10.060
ltt may end up collapsing under its own weight and our future may be

03:16:10.860 --> 03:16:16.380
Many smaller channels that only need to get 100,000 or 150,000 views average instead of

03:16:16.940 --> 03:16:18.620
needing to get

03:16:18.620 --> 03:16:20.140
a million and a half

03:16:20.140 --> 03:16:21.820
three million views

03:16:21.820 --> 03:16:23.820
on every video

03:16:23.820 --> 03:16:28.860
What made you change your mind on the take can from when you shot the original video featuring it android auto

03:16:29.180 --> 03:16:32.860
That was a big one for me. I I liked the car. I can afford the car

03:16:34.380 --> 03:16:38.700
It felt a little bit excessive at the time in particular

03:16:41.020 --> 03:16:46.780
I don't want a new car, but I don't think I would buy one without an android auto at this point. No, yeah, it's utterly unacceptable

03:16:47.260 --> 03:16:48.220
um, also

03:16:48.220 --> 03:16:55.660
I was extremely disappointed not just with Porsche's refusal to add android auto to their freaking cars

03:16:56.140 --> 03:16:58.940
But with the fact that they were not adding those features to

03:16:59.500 --> 03:17:03.420
Previous models it made me feel like this vehicle was not going to be well supported

03:17:03.740 --> 03:17:08.700
And I wasn't interested in owning one that wasn't going to get proper software support going forward

03:17:09.260 --> 03:17:11.500
So once they once they both

03:17:12.940 --> 03:17:19.660
Brought android auto to the take can and back ported that compatibility all the way to 2020 when they originally released the car

03:17:19.740 --> 03:17:21.100
I went

03:17:21.100 --> 03:17:28.540
Okay, well, that's my favorite electric car. Um, it looks cool. It's fast and stuff. Um, I haven't seen

03:17:29.260 --> 03:17:30.460
too many

03:17:30.460 --> 03:17:35.580
Complaints about it. I like it. I test drove a lot. Um, I was like, okay, sure

03:17:36.460 --> 03:17:40.700
And then how I ended up with the turbo s was basically just down to

03:17:41.500 --> 03:17:42.780
um

03:17:42.780 --> 03:17:47.100
Like uh, like a favorable deal on a second hand one that was barely driven. Yeah

03:17:47.900 --> 03:17:49.340
It's a way to go if you can pull it off

03:17:49.340 --> 03:17:55.260
Yeah, like I saved so much that even though it has a bunch of equipment that I wouldn't have otherwise shelled out for

03:17:55.260 --> 03:17:57.260
I effectively didn't pay for it. So

03:17:59.820 --> 03:18:05.260
Now that some time has passed since youtube removed dislikes, have you noticed any long-term effects?

03:18:05.740 --> 03:18:07.740
Uh,

03:18:08.060 --> 03:18:13.740
Other than it just being annoying not being able to see the sentiment on a video that I'm looking at no

03:18:14.860 --> 03:18:19.580
I mean, I didn't expect that it would affect the joe average viewer. It's just annoying for me the user

03:18:19.980 --> 03:18:22.700
Or rather, I didn't expect that it would affect me as a creator

03:18:23.340 --> 03:18:27.180
In terms of interacting with my viewers, but yeah, it does it does affect me as a user

03:18:28.540 --> 03:18:32.380
Question for luke. What is your favorite programming language and why?

03:18:33.340 --> 03:18:35.580
Uh, I actually always really like to see

03:18:36.940 --> 03:18:41.020
Oh, that makes me happy. Why that's my favorite too. Oh, that's the only one I know

03:18:41.500 --> 03:18:43.820
Um, are you guys having a moment?

03:18:45.900 --> 03:18:51.020
The fact that I I now manage web developers is so uh, do you guys need to hug right now?

03:18:53.340 --> 03:18:57.020
No, we program in c-linus. Yeah, that means we never hug anyone

03:18:57.180 --> 03:18:59.180
Yeah

03:19:01.740 --> 03:19:07.980
He knows he knows um favorite favorite things an x employee here said to me is uh, uh, you know

03:19:08.060 --> 03:19:12.380
I'm an extroverted, uh, you know programmer or whatever. Um, I look at the other person's shoes

03:19:15.580 --> 03:19:19.420
It took me a second, but that's great. Um, I I uh, yeah

03:19:19.980 --> 03:19:23.100
I find the fact that I manage a bunch of web developers to be very like

03:19:23.500 --> 03:19:25.100
Funny

03:19:25.100 --> 03:19:30.300
Because I hated web development when I was in school. It was my least favorite form

03:19:31.020 --> 03:19:34.460
Absolutely, and then now it's like oh, okay. That's fine

03:19:35.340 --> 03:19:39.580
Next been watching for a decade now and figured it's time. I show a little love

03:19:40.300 --> 03:19:46.620
Do you feel like people have gotten more or less tech savvy over time as tech has gotten more advanced but simpler to use

03:19:47.500 --> 03:19:54.780
Honestly, this isn't the kind of thing that I get to personally experience that much

03:19:55.420 --> 03:19:59.180
Um, but what I have seen is a lot of articles talking about how

03:20:00.220 --> 03:20:06.940
Baby boomers tend to be less tech savvy than gen X millennial who tend to be more tech savvy than

03:20:07.580 --> 03:20:09.580
Gen Z zoomer

03:20:09.580 --> 03:20:13.420
Um, so baby boomers didn't really have technology as they were growing up

03:20:13.660 --> 03:20:17.660
Zoomers have a really good technology that works really well

03:20:18.140 --> 03:20:23.260
And gen X and millennials had crappy technology that they really needed to work

03:20:23.420 --> 03:20:28.620
So they learned a lot of troubleshooting skills. If there's if there's a generalization that you can make I'd say that's pretty fair

03:20:28.940 --> 03:20:35.820
Yeah, um, I mean my my kids are finally getting to the age where they should start to you know, learn some basic troubleshooting

03:20:35.820 --> 03:20:37.820
And yeah, no, they don't they don't really have to

03:20:38.460 --> 03:20:42.060
Or I'm saying like they should in that I would have had to be learning it

03:20:42.540 --> 03:20:46.220
Like I had to know how to use the computer better than my parents by the time I was my son's age

03:20:46.220 --> 03:20:50.300
But he doesn't need to and I guess part of it too is just having more tech savvy parents

03:20:50.380 --> 03:20:55.100
I was just gonna think about it. That might not be true for everyone because he's pretty he's pretty good

03:20:55.980 --> 03:21:00.140
Well, he's good at certain things that I don't know actually which is a really good point

03:21:00.540 --> 03:21:05.980
Like he can he can freaking command blah blah his minecraft way around things

03:21:06.060 --> 03:21:08.060
And I don't know how the crap minecraft works. Yeah

03:21:08.620 --> 03:21:14.940
But you know, if I needed if I needed, you know to block a domain for example because I don't want my kids on tiktok

03:21:14.940 --> 03:21:17.660
Then obviously he's not gonna have a way around that

03:21:19.580 --> 03:21:25.900
Hi DLL Luke with the difficulties getting good internet in places like Australia for float plane servers

03:21:26.300 --> 03:21:31.900
Is that is that something that starlink can help with or does that only help people watching?

03:21:32.860 --> 03:21:38.700
Uh, it's it's the the problem is routing. So there there is an isp. I don't remember which one

03:21:38.780 --> 03:21:43.500
I don't know. Uh, there is an isp in Australia that we have no problems with like at all

03:21:44.220 --> 03:21:49.180
There are other isps in Australia that we have tons of problems with tons of problems with

03:21:49.580 --> 03:21:52.620
We do delivery for australia through cloudflare

03:21:52.940 --> 03:21:56.460
Um, so we are working with cloudflare right now. We have an open ticket with him

03:21:56.540 --> 03:22:00.380
Whether it's been so back and forth we're working with cloudflare right now to figure that out

03:22:01.340 --> 03:22:03.820
Because we're not doing delivery to

03:22:04.700 --> 03:22:10.140
australian viewers of float plane through float plane servers in australia

03:22:11.340 --> 03:22:13.820
We are doing delivery to australians through cloudflare

03:22:15.100 --> 03:22:21.420
So it is pretty wild to me because delivery everywhere else in the world is pretty good

03:22:22.300 --> 03:22:24.300
that uh, there are

03:22:24.460 --> 03:22:26.460
australian isps

03:22:26.460 --> 03:22:31.100
That can have bad routing to a company that like runs half the world's internet

03:22:31.580 --> 03:22:35.900
Um, if you know what I mean by that because that's not that's obviously not true

03:22:35.980 --> 03:22:39.420
But like I think you get it. Uh, so yeah, I don't know

03:22:40.060 --> 03:22:43.660
We we're working on it if what we end up having to do is have more than one

03:22:44.220 --> 03:22:46.220
um

03:22:46.300 --> 03:22:49.020
Delivery partner that is like if we if we find

03:22:49.500 --> 03:22:54.700
Uh, uh a way to serve better to the other range of australian isps and whatnot

03:22:55.020 --> 03:22:58.780
We will do it. We're not going to just leave you stuck in this bad situation forever

03:22:59.100 --> 03:23:02.940
But right now we're trying to just work with cloudflare to figure it out because

03:23:03.660 --> 03:23:05.500
Yeah, it's annoying

03:23:05.500 --> 03:23:09.180
And I apologize. I'm going to give luke another one while line is finishes off those potentials

03:23:09.180 --> 03:23:12.620
And we'll try and rapid fire a few more of these. Hi. I'm a developer

03:23:12.700 --> 03:23:17.500
I'm curious what kind of stack is being used for labs like the database front end and stuff

03:23:18.860 --> 03:23:23.260
Uh database the main one we're using we use more than one but the main one we're using is postgres

03:23:24.220 --> 03:23:26.220
The front end is

03:23:27.660 --> 03:23:32.620
The front end is react through next and the back end is type script. Hopefully that answers all the things you're looking for

03:23:33.580 --> 03:23:37.580
ADLL line has previously said he would not mind to be in south park

03:23:37.980 --> 03:23:44.300
What would be the episode what would the episode be about and would he care if they portrayed other employees of lmg?

03:23:46.780 --> 03:23:49.820
I suspect some other employees of lmg might not want to be involved

03:23:49.820 --> 03:23:55.260
I would obviously love to be included. They can make fun of me. However, they want that'd be hilarious. Um

03:23:58.220 --> 03:24:00.220
What episode would it be

03:24:00.940 --> 03:24:04.380
I have no idea not a clue. I mean, you know what?

03:24:04.940 --> 03:24:11.260
Actually, if there was literally just an episode about some crazy canadian youtuber opening a badminton center would probably be

03:24:11.740 --> 03:24:17.100
Yeah, but that would be that wouldn't be a south park episode that has no like deeper sort of right. It needs yeah

03:24:17.420 --> 03:24:19.740
Um, I'd say if there was an existing episode

03:24:19.740 --> 03:24:25.660
I would love it to be the one where they travel all the way to san francisco to like unplug and replug the giant link sys router

03:24:27.100 --> 03:24:30.620
I'd love to be involved in that plot line somehow. That'd be pretty good

03:24:31.580 --> 03:24:36.060
Hi ltt question for linus. I got tailgated on my way home today

03:24:36.780 --> 03:24:41.900
What is the worst driving you've seen from someone else on the road? Oh my god

03:24:42.540 --> 03:24:44.540
I think I've told this story on wancho before

03:24:45.020 --> 03:24:47.020
Stop me if you've heard it

03:24:47.340 --> 03:24:49.340
But I was at abradeen center mall

03:24:51.420 --> 03:24:53.420
Luke knows where this is going

03:24:53.740 --> 03:24:54.860
um

03:24:54.860 --> 03:24:55.820
and

03:24:55.820 --> 03:25:03.340
The car in front of me was turning out of the parking lot. Oh, I do know this story, but keep going. Okay

03:25:03.900 --> 03:25:05.900
So there's a pillar here

03:25:06.300 --> 03:25:08.300
They take the corner too tight

03:25:08.460 --> 03:25:09.260
and

03:25:09.260 --> 03:25:15.740
About I don't know man. I maybe like halfway up the car. Maybe not even halfway. They like

03:25:16.460 --> 03:25:18.460
Hit they they scrape the pillar

03:25:19.500 --> 03:25:21.420
Okay

03:25:21.420 --> 03:25:23.420
Now you would think they're in like

03:25:24.540 --> 03:25:26.540
I don't want to generalize

03:25:26.860 --> 03:25:28.860
But they're in a bmws uv

03:25:29.420 --> 03:25:31.420
Okay, so

03:25:33.180 --> 03:25:36.220
You would think that they would back up

03:25:37.900 --> 03:25:39.900
Maybe get out of the car

03:25:39.980 --> 03:25:43.100
Assess the damage find the best way to get out of the situation. Yeah

03:25:44.060 --> 03:25:47.660
No, man power through brother. They hit the gas

03:25:51.980 --> 03:25:56.380
They scrape they take what would have been one panel that needed to be

03:25:58.220 --> 03:26:00.220
Restored repainted

03:26:00.540 --> 03:26:02.540
And they run that pole

03:26:03.100 --> 03:26:09.660
Down the entire f***ing side of what is probably like an 85 thousand dollar suv

03:26:10.620 --> 03:26:14.380
They they they go out to the light they turn away. I never see them

03:26:14.380 --> 03:26:17.740
I watch I'm what I'm sitting. I'm behind them watching this whole thing play out

03:26:17.740 --> 03:26:22.460
I'm like my my jaw is on in my lap just

03:26:25.020 --> 03:26:31.020
Unfathomable actually unfathomable behavior. Oh, yeah, and it it it's it's not

03:26:31.820 --> 03:26:37.260
You know, it's it's not like they it was like they hit and run someone else's something or anything

03:26:37.340 --> 03:26:44.140
No, there was no victim utterly victimless crime that pole just that structural support just there that

03:26:45.100 --> 03:26:47.100
I don't know

03:26:47.260 --> 03:26:53.740
I don't know. Do they not care about the money or the the the extra time even the time the car's going to be in the shop

03:26:53.740 --> 03:26:55.420
Don't you want your car?

03:26:55.420 --> 03:26:57.420
You know

03:26:58.540 --> 03:26:59.900
Mine uh

03:26:59.900 --> 03:27:05.020
This isn't my most ridiculous story, but it's my most recent one literally last night. I almost got ran over

03:27:05.740 --> 03:27:07.740
Um, I was driving

03:27:07.980 --> 03:27:09.980
Uh, I'll actually be pretty specific

03:27:10.140 --> 03:27:13.740
I was driving up the hill on 200th by like the best buying stuff

03:27:14.300 --> 03:27:18.780
And there was this big truck in the lane beside me and just decided to

03:27:19.660 --> 03:27:25.180
All the sudden over into my lane and I had to crank the wheel to dodge over to the side

03:27:25.820 --> 03:27:27.260
and then just

03:27:27.260 --> 03:27:28.860
You you see him like

03:27:28.860 --> 03:27:33.020
Realized that I'm there and that I just dodged him and go back into his own lane

03:27:33.020 --> 03:27:36.620
I actually have no idea if it was a he or she or whatever. I don't know. I'm just we're generalizing

03:27:37.100 --> 03:27:38.220
um

03:27:38.220 --> 03:27:40.220
Go back into their own lane

03:27:40.220 --> 03:27:43.580
And then kind of like pause for a second and then just foot on the floor

03:27:43.820 --> 03:27:46.540
And you know how it's like a lot of lanes there foot on the floor

03:27:47.100 --> 03:27:49.500
Whips past me goes all the way way

03:27:49.980 --> 03:27:55.980
Wide right to get around everybody blows past people goes the the light is green gets way up in the front

03:27:55.980 --> 03:28:00.860
It goes all the way way over to the left. No, it's a no just a big like lifted truck. Got it. Oh

03:28:01.820 --> 03:28:07.740
Yeah, I was like a professional driver. No, no, no, no, no got it flies all over the place all this kind of stuff

03:28:07.980 --> 03:28:12.060
We get to the the next light past that one and I mean

03:28:12.700 --> 03:28:15.740
As per usual, they're just right there because they didn't get away

03:28:15.980 --> 03:28:20.780
So I like laid into the horn a little bit when it first happened because I wasn't even sure if they saw me at all

03:28:21.180 --> 03:28:24.060
And then when we got up there, I gave them a little like I still see you

03:28:25.900 --> 03:28:28.940
I like that passive aggressive move. Yeah, I approve. Yeah

03:28:29.100 --> 03:28:35.500
But that was uh, that was fun. Yeah, like would have completely totaled my car because their

03:28:36.540 --> 03:28:39.580
Front tire would have gone over my front left fender

03:28:40.460 --> 03:28:43.900
And just like dropped right into my engine bay. So that would have sucked

03:28:44.300 --> 03:28:45.900
um

03:28:45.900 --> 03:28:47.900
But yeah made it

03:28:48.220 --> 03:28:50.060
dodged them

03:28:50.060 --> 03:28:55.260
Almost had a reason to get a new car, but now I still don't have a reason to get a new car. So I'm okay with that

03:28:56.220 --> 03:29:02.060
Are your fixed screwdrivers going to be through tang so they are durable and can be hammered?

03:29:03.100 --> 03:29:05.100
um, no

03:29:05.260 --> 03:29:08.220
The reason for that is that if we were

03:29:10.220 --> 03:29:20.780
Our main goal is to make them available in a wide variety of different handle configurations and shaft thicknesses and shaft lengths

03:29:21.260 --> 03:29:26.140
And so we are going to have them be sort of semi modular so we can stock

03:29:26.780 --> 03:29:31.500
Components of screwdrivers and then build them to order essentially not quite to order, but we can

03:29:32.140 --> 03:29:37.260
Build from our stock of of shafts and handles so you can kind of mix and match them when you when you order

03:29:37.260 --> 03:29:41.180
You can get exactly the screwdriver you want and for us to do that

03:29:42.140 --> 03:29:44.140
For us to do like a through tang

03:29:45.020 --> 03:29:48.060
We wouldn't be able to customize them to that degree

03:29:48.620 --> 03:29:50.220
um

03:29:50.220 --> 03:29:52.220
unfortunately

03:29:53.500 --> 03:29:57.900
Love using the screwdriver every day in my wind tunnel at nasa sick

03:29:58.780 --> 03:30:04.220
Given your recent interest in lab grade equipment. What is a lab you would love to visit?

03:30:04.860 --> 03:30:08.380
Wherever you are, you should reach out and invite us to check out your wind tunnel at nasa

03:30:10.060 --> 03:30:13.260
That'd be awesome. You're shameless. I'm just gonna collect all the nasa people. Yeah, I see

03:30:14.620 --> 03:30:17.100
That's so cool. Um, I'm serious by the way

03:30:19.020 --> 03:30:20.540
man

03:30:20.540 --> 03:30:22.540
Something I haven't

03:30:23.100 --> 03:30:25.100
Gone too yet

03:30:25.820 --> 03:30:33.900
Honestly, I would kind of rather my engineers go look if that kind of makes sense because I'm not the one who's involved in developing these test procedures

03:30:33.900 --> 03:30:38.300
These days anymore, right? Like I it's it's above my pay grade. So

03:30:39.580 --> 03:30:43.420
Yeah, I I I would rather ask the engineers what what they want to see

03:30:43.900 --> 03:30:48.860
I think that it would be really cool. We oh, you know what we actually had um, I'll go to

03:30:51.180 --> 03:30:53.180
Uh

03:30:53.740 --> 03:30:56.620
We had dxomark reach out to us and

03:30:57.260 --> 03:31:00.620
want to collaborate on like a tour of their place and

03:31:01.020 --> 03:31:06.300
Like collaborate on on sharing methodologies with each other and stuff like that. I thought that was super cool. That's awesome

03:31:06.620 --> 03:31:09.420
Yeah, so and we'd totally be open to reciprocating as well

03:31:09.420 --> 03:31:12.380
If anyone wanted to check out what we're doing, maybe it was for a little bit better setup

03:31:12.940 --> 03:31:14.140
We're still

03:31:14.140 --> 03:31:16.540
We still have a lot of equipment to get in place

03:31:17.100 --> 03:31:21.260
Um, we started off with a really wide scope of the amount of things we wanted to do

03:31:21.340 --> 03:31:25.820
We really did. Yeah, and the reality of it is I don't think there was an alternative to that

03:31:26.220 --> 03:31:28.220
Yeah, because it would have taken forever

03:31:28.700 --> 03:31:31.980
Just based even just based on never mind hiring hiring takes forever

03:31:32.060 --> 03:31:34.940
But like lead time of freaking equipment takes forever

03:31:34.940 --> 03:31:38.460
We would we would have we would have never gotten to video cards

03:31:38.700 --> 03:31:44.140
If we had waited to start video cards until after we had mastered power supplies

03:31:44.540 --> 03:31:50.220
And cpus and gpus and headphones and blah blah blah blah blah like it just it just would have never happened

03:31:50.700 --> 03:31:54.140
So now we're just gonna go parallel go wide

03:31:55.100 --> 03:31:56.300
Yeah, we could

03:31:56.300 --> 03:31:59.500
Then some stuff will eventually get over the line and other stuff will take a little longer

03:31:59.500 --> 03:32:01.500
And then at least we'll have that some stuff done

03:32:02.220 --> 03:32:07.500
Is it worth getting an eight gig card nowadays if you plan on sticking with 1080p for the next few years

03:32:07.900 --> 03:32:10.940
Also update on the wooden handle screwdriver

03:32:11.980 --> 03:32:16.380
The lower the detail level you play at the less likely you are to run into a vram limitation

03:32:16.700 --> 03:32:23.020
And the lower end the gpu you have the less likely you are to be running on ultra settings

03:32:23.660 --> 03:32:29.340
With that said there are some ports recently that are well capable of utilizing more than eight gigs of vram

03:32:30.140 --> 03:32:36.620
With playable settings. So it all depends on, you know, how much you expect to run games at the maximum settings

03:32:36.700 --> 03:32:42.060
I mean, there are cases where an eight gig gpu is substantially cheaper than one with more vram

03:32:43.580 --> 03:32:49.180
Sort of except that there are also cases where you can get a gpu with more vram

03:32:51.020 --> 03:32:53.340
For the same price or in some cases even less

03:32:53.500 --> 03:32:58.940
So if you must buy something brand new current generation, yeah, you kind of have no choice

03:32:59.260 --> 03:33:04.380
I guess get an eight gig card or something and don't expect her, you know run at maximum texture quality

03:33:05.260 --> 03:33:11.180
But if you're willing to explore other options, there's last gen cards from amd that are particularly good value right now

03:33:11.340 --> 03:33:15.100
And we did that video recently where I found that

03:33:15.820 --> 03:33:17.500
10 gig

03:33:17.500 --> 03:33:19.500
rtx 3080s are just

03:33:19.900 --> 03:33:26.860
Killer value right now like I paid about the same as you'd pay for a 40 60 ti for a card that is way faster

03:33:27.580 --> 03:33:32.700
Has 20 more vram and still had like 10 months of warranty on it

03:33:33.660 --> 03:33:35.260
No, brainer

03:33:35.260 --> 03:33:40.300
We got to uh, there isn't that many left, but we do have to crank it out because you got you got 12 minutes

03:33:40.940 --> 03:33:46.460
Oh, yeah, okay. Let's try and finish in five and we'll play one game hockey before I go. Nice. Nice. Okay

03:33:46.780 --> 03:33:50.700
Hi, mr. Tech tips you read my tech hot take about evs and walkable cities

03:33:50.780 --> 03:33:55.980
And I really enjoyed reading discussions about it in the comments. What is your favorite discourse started by you?

03:33:55.980 --> 03:33:57.980
You

03:34:00.860 --> 03:34:02.860
Warranty discussion

03:34:08.540 --> 03:34:15.340
Let's talk about how meaningful a written warranty is yeah, let's do it. I do think you I opened a bunch

03:34:16.140 --> 03:34:20.620
Hi, there's also a lot of people that are like no, no, no, no

03:34:21.740 --> 03:34:23.740
So I don't know

03:34:24.620 --> 03:34:29.900
I don't care we can talk about it. No, we're not talking about okay. I always like to hear l&l work relationship stories

03:34:31.340 --> 03:34:39.100
Uh, what are some luke tips for advocating for his team when bringing issues to Linus? I I mean, it's not

03:34:44.140 --> 03:34:48.060
There's a lot of ways I could say this that would like misrepresent how it actually goes

03:34:48.860 --> 03:34:50.860
I don't think it's actually

03:34:51.820 --> 03:34:58.780
Difficult like you you see you watch if you watch a movie and there's like some boss who's like a jerk and refuses to listen

03:34:59.740 --> 03:35:02.780
To the like engineer people like that's not what's going on

03:35:02.940 --> 03:35:07.180
I have to bring a good enough argument why we can't or won't or shouldn't do something

03:35:07.260 --> 03:35:10.060
But if I do so Linus will listen to it. So like

03:35:10.860 --> 03:35:14.060
I don't know bring a good enough argument or find a better boss

03:35:15.740 --> 03:35:18.300
Or I'll say no, we can't right now and I'll provide a reason

03:35:18.940 --> 03:35:22.540
But you have to you have to reach like you have to reach consensus. Yeah

03:35:23.580 --> 03:35:25.580
so be open yourself

03:35:26.140 --> 03:35:27.020
to

03:35:27.020 --> 03:35:31.260
Changing your stance on things based on on whatever you this is a two-way street

03:35:31.740 --> 03:35:36.540
And then also make sure that you're working with someone who will do that or try to find gainful employment elsewhere

03:35:37.660 --> 03:35:38.940
Did you hear that

03:35:38.940 --> 03:35:45.980
Gamers nexus and level one techs want to try to make a standard for rgb and fan control stuff where yeah thoughts good luck

03:35:46.380 --> 03:35:53.660
Yeah, I hope it doesn't go the xkcd. Is that it xkcd way? I've referenced that so many times today actually

03:35:53.740 --> 03:35:58.540
Yeah, hey, let's make a new stator. There's too many standards. Let's make a standard that unifies them all there are now

03:35:58.860 --> 03:36:02.220
One more standards 927. I think I mean the problem

03:36:04.220 --> 03:36:10.540
The problem from my point of view is that they need buy-in from the pc hardware industry. That's tough and um

03:36:11.820 --> 03:36:13.820
you know

03:36:14.460 --> 03:36:17.180
We don't even have standard connectors for like

03:36:18.380 --> 03:36:20.220
power buttons

03:36:20.220 --> 03:36:22.780
and power leds like we don't even have a standard header for that

03:36:24.060 --> 03:36:26.060
rgb is a lot more complex

03:36:26.860 --> 03:36:28.140
than like

03:36:28.140 --> 03:36:32.460
Putting those pins in the same spot. Can we all just put those pins in the same spot? No

03:36:33.580 --> 03:36:36.860
Well, okay, then. Be pretty sweet if we could. Yeah, good luck

03:36:37.340 --> 03:36:42.780
Super excited for game linked any plans for retro content in addition to the newest releases

03:36:43.260 --> 03:36:45.260
Game linked is it's mostly news

03:36:46.300 --> 03:36:48.140
Yep

03:36:48.140 --> 03:36:50.140
Um, let's see. Hey lmg crew

03:36:50.460 --> 03:36:57.020
I went to a new doctor recently and that day and thereafter I had received constant spam calls

03:36:57.420 --> 03:37:02.060
How do you guys feel about doctors or other companies selling your information does ltt?

03:37:02.700 --> 03:37:04.700
Of course not. No, we don't

03:37:05.020 --> 03:37:08.620
And that is super bs that any doctor anyone else should be able to

03:37:09.420 --> 03:37:11.420
And hopefully they get crushed legally

03:37:13.740 --> 03:37:15.740
And you want the last potential

03:37:16.780 --> 03:37:22.300
Uh, yeah, send it. I have a physical disability that makes my dexterity not the best

03:37:22.540 --> 03:37:27.820
But the ltt screwdriver made my building my pc so accessible for me. Thank you

03:37:28.220 --> 03:37:34.300
Any other merch you think makes life accessible? I mean, I wouldn't have thought the screwdriver made life particularly accessible

03:37:34.300 --> 03:37:40.300
I'm wondering if it's because it's the lack of the back force. That's right. Oh, I can almost guarantee that. Yeah. Oh, that makes sense

03:37:40.620 --> 03:37:47.020
Yeah, I just like it. So we made it good. Um, I don't know what else to tell you. Oh, wait

03:37:48.540 --> 03:37:52.060
Okay, no, no, this is I'm so sorry. This is totally unrelated to your question

03:37:52.140 --> 03:37:57.500
I I actually cannot think of anything but someone else asked about updates on the wooden screwdriver and I didn't respond to that part

03:37:57.740 --> 03:37:58.940
Oh

03:37:58.940 --> 03:38:00.940
It looks like it might be possible

03:38:01.740 --> 03:38:03.740
It's not going to be cheap

03:38:03.740 --> 03:38:05.740
We have to we have to do like a metal

03:38:06.220 --> 03:38:09.500
Collar for the selector ring and then like

03:38:10.060 --> 03:38:12.940
Machine out a wooden like cover for it

03:38:13.580 --> 03:38:16.780
Because it has to be metal on the inside. It can't be made of wood. Yeah

03:38:17.180 --> 03:38:18.540
Um

03:38:18.540 --> 03:38:20.540
This part I think we can machine

03:38:21.020 --> 03:38:25.980
Uh, yeah, I think we can do it, but it's going to be really expensive

03:38:26.700 --> 03:38:30.540
like this is going to be a premium tool and um

03:38:31.260 --> 03:38:33.260
You'll feel dumb for buying it

03:38:33.500 --> 03:38:34.940
I'll say that

03:38:34.940 --> 03:38:35.980
I

03:38:35.980 --> 03:38:39.180
witnessed a certain version of a screwdriver

03:38:39.820 --> 03:38:41.820
That nick showed me today

03:38:43.820 --> 03:38:45.820
I'm not problem. Whoa

03:38:46.860 --> 03:38:48.860
Whoa

03:38:50.300 --> 03:38:54.300
I even want to know how much that's going to be like three or four hundred dollars if it ever makes it

03:38:54.380 --> 03:38:56.380
I'm surprised. It's that little

03:38:56.780 --> 03:39:02.540
Yeah, I don't know. I expect it honestly like way higher. I don't think that'll ever make it. I don't think so either

03:39:03.180 --> 03:39:06.380
It's amazing the engineering team. Okay, you know, I might as well tell you guys

03:39:06.700 --> 03:39:10.220
You know the stupid 3d printed version of the screwdriver

03:39:11.020 --> 03:39:16.380
Okay, well, they did a machined version of a slightly less heavy stupid metal

03:39:17.020 --> 03:39:24.940
And they managed to assemble a fully working. Oh, yeah, all metal screwdriver made it. I think it's aluminum and brass

03:39:25.820 --> 03:39:27.820
Um, it's kind of amazing

03:39:27.820 --> 03:39:34.860
That's probably not going to happen the amount of machine time for that thing is ridiculous and the difficulty compared to

03:39:35.580 --> 03:39:39.420
Doing something in wood. I think is going to be very very high

03:39:39.900 --> 03:39:44.300
Yes, and it makes no sense. It's going to be so flip and heavy. It was really heavy

03:39:44.300 --> 03:39:48.460
It's really heavy and that's the aluminum one the steel one tine and has it as desk the 3d printed one

03:39:48.460 --> 03:39:52.380
It's just like it's it's like a weight. He just curls it. It's why he's so huge

03:39:53.740 --> 03:39:55.660
Yeah

03:39:55.660 --> 03:39:59.900
And this is the huge end of the show. Thank you guys so much for tuning in

03:39:59.980 --> 03:40:03.660
We will see you again next week. Same bad time. Same bad channel. Bye

03:40:13.100 --> 03:40:15.100
I have no idea how many

03:40:25.660 --> 03:40:27.660
How many people watch today?
