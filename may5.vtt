WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Oh

00:10.960 --> 00:16.360
Did you like my misdirection everyone's like why is float playing down and I was like sorry guys I farted

00:19.120 --> 00:22.160
What told me took the whole server down it was so explosive

00:22.880 --> 00:29.360
Jonathan Jonathan's in the hospital from smoke inhalation now. It was it was very damaging smoke inhalation. Yeah

00:31.000 --> 00:33.800
That's what happens when you let an explosive one just rip

00:36.840 --> 00:39.560
We give people actual information no

00:42.840 --> 00:51.200
Cool let's get this show started cuz Luke's got a thing he's got to go to yeah, I am going to resume the selected

00:55.960 --> 00:57.960
Oh, we're just okay

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Oh

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
You

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I

02:44.000 --> 02:46.240
Is this on us this is related it shouldn't be

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You

03:30.420 --> 03:34.300
You know what I think I know what it is

03:37.800 --> 03:42.040
I'm gonna do a thing do not show my screen

03:52.200 --> 03:54.200
This is a good idea

03:55.280 --> 03:57.280
Oh wait

04:00.360 --> 04:03.320
By the way, I I don't know if you see my screen when I do this

04:03.320 --> 04:08.400
But everyone's while I type it out if he's typing in a password you should try to mute his mic

04:14.840 --> 04:16.840
No, that wasn't it

04:17.080 --> 04:19.080
Hmm

04:28.560 --> 04:35.760
Could it be something to do with this it really shouldn't be but like

04:46.840 --> 04:52.680
Oh boy, yeah, that's truly awful

05:00.080 --> 05:02.080
Why is nothing ever easy

05:17.120 --> 05:21.960
Yeah, I can't repause the selected either it's just a gray spinning arrow forever. Oh

05:26.960 --> 05:32.980
But it might be related to a thing that happened not that we did though

05:42.560 --> 05:45.400
That might have caused the back-end error

05:47.560 --> 05:50.520
We never had it happen before but it could be

05:51.960 --> 05:55.840
Because like the live streaming stuff should be completely detached, so it's like actually weird

05:58.240 --> 06:04.880
No, not yet. Is there any way for us to stream to two separate stream keys? Well, then why don't we just do that?

06:06.880 --> 06:10.480
So we start what just fire up another instance of OBS and then streamed

06:11.200 --> 06:16.480
You and me and you and you

06:17.960 --> 06:20.560
Do we need to entertain you streaming baby?

06:22.000 --> 06:28.960
Do we need to get the thing over logged in for him so he can see all the keys you have them all

06:28.960 --> 06:30.960
I

06:34.960 --> 06:39.920
Directly to YouTube we need direct to float. No, we don't need direct to float plane

06:41.040 --> 06:46.120
Yeah, oh, it just won't I just can't I just can't change settings. Ah

06:47.320 --> 06:49.820
So that seems like us no

06:50.760 --> 06:52.760
Or wait. Yeah, no, I don't know then

06:53.520 --> 07:01.760
Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. So yeah, let's just activate YouTube separately. Yeah

07:09.880 --> 07:12.080
How do you know my password legendary skate?

07:12.080 --> 07:27.160
You're gonna have to tell me when it's going our wait. No, I can refresh the YouTube studio to see when it goes live

07:34.680 --> 07:36.680
The pause that lasted a millennium

07:37.440 --> 07:39.440
I

07:41.080 --> 07:43.080
Mean you let me know

07:49.880 --> 07:56.720
What is up bells and W's and welcome to the WAN show we've got a great show lined up for you guys today

07:56.720 --> 07:59.440
Lots of great topics actually including

07:59.880 --> 08:01.880
What discord?

08:02.240 --> 08:05.880
Discord is taking away the four digit numbers at the end of username

08:06.880 --> 08:10.000
How could they do this? You can't be Luke number

08:10.760 --> 08:13.920
8,600 and you know 42 I was Luke

08:14.560 --> 08:19.040
001 and they took it away from me. No way. I have no idea why

08:19.600 --> 08:25.040
They must have given it to a more important Luke probably. Yeah, rude probably Luke Wilson

08:25.600 --> 08:32.840
In other news EA is blaming gamers for using hard high-end hardware on Windows 10

08:33.200 --> 08:38.800
For Star Wars Jedi survivor performance issues, we're gonna be getting into that. What else we got today

08:38.840 --> 08:44.240
That's the one I wanted to talk about and you got wrecked the pixel fold

08:44.600 --> 08:50.080
Was officially announced after you know, just like every other pixel device. It was leaked to every wow

08:50.400 --> 08:53.320
It's a folding phone. That's a man that wants to replace his phone

08:53.520 --> 09:01.080
Also OBS adds AV one for YouTube live streams, which is actually huge. We'll talk about that actually huge

09:01.480 --> 09:06.480
Not huge, but like we're lying to you huge actually huge huge

09:06.480 --> 09:32.320
The show is brought to you today by Hot Wheels Rift Rally Zoho one and

09:33.040 --> 09:34.240
Squarespace

09:34.240 --> 09:41.720
Why don't we jump right into our headline topic, which I completely forget what it is right discord. Ah, I have to change my name

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah, me too. I guess this is written. I

09:44.640 --> 09:46.640
Okay, let's go through the facts

09:46.640 --> 09:51.920
frenzy, okay the our original article here is from the Verge, but also from discord themselves

09:51.920 --> 09:56.520
This is not fake news discord usernames will be evolving

09:56.520 --> 10:04.000
So instead of 5i and hashtag eight nine three six Oh Phoebe probably pretty sure now we're gonna be Phoebe

10:04.880 --> 10:10.640
Handle at Phoebe is cool because you are obviously not going to get at Phoebe

10:10.880 --> 10:16.080
Which I think the idea here is that it's gonna make usernames easier to share

10:18.400 --> 10:20.400
But we know from

10:20.400 --> 10:25.840
Experience right the people just camp them and stuff every creators name is just gonna be gone

10:26.160 --> 10:30.080
Yeah, up to literally thousands of numbers after it

10:30.080 --> 10:38.120
I mean I learned this way back when having a good at hotmail calm email address was a mark of being kind of cool and with it

10:38.120 --> 10:39.880
Oh, yeah, I

10:39.880 --> 10:41.880
Was cool with it and

10:42.440 --> 10:47.640
Then the same thing happened with Gmail and then the same thing happened with Twitter and now they're saying

10:48.000 --> 10:53.600
That seems like a good system. Let's follow those. We solved that before but let's unsolve it

10:53.600 --> 10:56.960
Let's go back to the just at and a string of characters

10:56.960 --> 11:01.920
So in theory I kind of see where they're coming from because as a brand new user

11:01.920 --> 11:08.080
There are certain aspects of discord in user interface and user experience. He struggles with it so much

11:08.760 --> 11:10.920
You can literally barely use discord

11:10.920 --> 11:16.560
It's actually very weird because you're usually very good and nimble in different user interfaces

11:16.560 --> 11:18.160
Then you hit discord is just like

11:18.200 --> 11:25.600
There are certain things I do find incredibly confusing like the fact that all of your individual chats are

11:26.480 --> 11:28.760
Like mixed in with the servers and stuff

11:28.880 --> 11:32.160
Yeah, it took me a little while to kind of wrap my brain around it

11:32.160 --> 11:36.360
But you haven't seen me try to use discord in quite some time. I'm fairly proficient these days

11:36.360 --> 11:43.560
Okay, okay, and one of the things that was a little bit confusing for me was the the the hashtag numbers because I didn't

11:44.080 --> 11:48.000
Coming into it completely cold not looking at but how to discord

11:48.160 --> 11:54.200
Guide and not really having anyone show me how I was just sitting there trying to like set it up because I think the

11:54.200 --> 12:00.120
Maybe you need a tech tip. No, I think the reason I got it first was because we added a discord

12:00.480 --> 12:04.000
Like Jake created the LTT discord and I was like, okay

12:04.000 --> 12:07.680
Well, I should probably finally use this have an account or something

12:07.680 --> 12:09.680
I hadn't really I hadn't really

12:09.680 --> 12:14.800
Gamed with friends in a very long time like since I used mumble with my group of friends. So

12:15.560 --> 12:17.560
Okay, this new fangled

12:18.080 --> 12:22.360
When the kids were quite young you were pretty. Oh, yeah, they were they weren't touching it yet

12:22.360 --> 12:27.600
Yeah, and you were offline. Yeah, I showed them how to use discord like that was that came way later

12:27.600 --> 12:30.820
Yeah, and so this this hashtag number thing was

12:31.560 --> 12:34.200
Actually a little bit confusing and unless you're copy pasting

12:35.000 --> 12:36.720
It's a little bit harder to remember

12:36.720 --> 12:41.160
I mean obviously it's not nearly as hard as remembering your icq number back in the day

12:42.040 --> 12:45.520
Yeah, fair enough, but like I don't know my numbers on discord

12:45.520 --> 12:51.800
But then here's the thing if the intent here is to make things more shareable make them easier to understand

12:51.800 --> 12:57.440
We know that users are gonna fill their their ads with special characters and with numbers anyway

12:57.440 --> 13:02.640
And we know that remembering a four-digit number is not actually a huge problem

13:02.640 --> 13:06.240
And you can individually change your nickname on every server in every chat anyways

13:06.280 --> 13:11.880
I mean look just knowing someone's name isn't gonna matter a phone numbers here in the lower mainland used to be seven numbers

13:11.880 --> 13:16.920
Do you know your first seven-digit phone number that you ever had like your home phone? Yes?

13:19.080 --> 13:28.200
Addresses street addresses are five numeric digits here. Do you remember the four to five number? Okay. Yeah

13:28.920 --> 13:30.920
This is not a huge problem

13:31.360 --> 13:32.600
and

13:32.600 --> 13:37.600
Okay, again, I haven't even gone through the facts here, but one of the things that I've seen at least

13:37.880 --> 13:40.760
Speculated we'll get into facts in a second for now. I'm just angry

13:41.760 --> 13:44.800
I'm not even angry. It just I'm just

13:46.440 --> 13:49.400
Like why yeah, yeah, I'm just I'm asking why

13:51.160 --> 13:56.160
And so one of the what what's what's a fact here is that it's not that hard

13:56.160 --> 13:58.360
And it's not an unreasonable expectation

13:58.400 --> 14:03.480
And it's not a new thing to expect people to remember a four-digit number and that's

14:04.000 --> 14:09.360
Perfectly fine. And so the fact that you're now changing it is gonna. So a lot of discord

14:11.360 --> 14:13.360
Very good

14:14.560 --> 14:21.480
Seemingly in the name of making it more user-friendly in a way that quite honestly if I go back even further

14:22.480 --> 14:26.000
Well as a non-user of the at system

14:26.000 --> 14:30.880
I found extremely confusing when I first got set up on Twitter. I

14:31.560 --> 14:34.560
Would whenever I would read a tweet

14:34.560 --> 14:41.300
I would read the the at symbol as at so when I'm so I'm reading along and it's like

14:41.520 --> 14:46.080
Hey at Luke. I something something so that's how I that's how I would read it. I

14:47.080 --> 14:49.160
Came into Twitter pretty late as well

14:50.160 --> 14:55.960
Anyway, let's let's see. Let's see. Let's see what their rationale is really. Oh, yeah, super late. I

14:56.960 --> 15:03.140
Basically ignored it. I was like, ah, I don't feel like dealing with wasn't wasn't you were definitely on Twitter in 2012

15:03.640 --> 15:05.640
Yes, because our first our first

15:06.280 --> 15:09.560
Back-and-forth direct message interaction is hilarious. Oh

15:10.400 --> 15:17.320
I don't remember this. Don't don't read it. Why read it later? Okay, sure. I

15:18.240 --> 15:20.240
Don't know a joint November

15:20.480 --> 15:22.480
2011

15:23.640 --> 15:25.640
When did Twitter start

15:27.200 --> 15:28.640
2006

15:28.640 --> 15:34.040
Whoa, right. Okay, but did like anyone use it? Yeah for sure. All right. Yeah

15:34.040 --> 15:41.600
So it's it's really funny because I think the only reason I started Twitter. Yeah, and the timing seems about right

15:42.440 --> 15:48.440
2011 yeah, it would have been when the when the LTT channel was starting to kind of gain some momentum

15:48.440 --> 15:54.960
And I was looking at it going like oh, I should probably have some kind of presence online other than this

15:55.720 --> 16:02.040
And it was probably around the time that NCIX was starting to build up a Twitter presence because all of a sudden companies

16:02.320 --> 16:07.800
Being on social media was a thing so that you could respond to people, you know

16:08.040 --> 16:14.600
Generating hate storms complaining about you and that sort of thing which is still what it's used for today, which is fantastic

16:15.440 --> 16:20.840
Okay, so let's go through the facts here now that I've talked through how sort of flabbergasting I'm finding this

16:20.840 --> 16:24.920
I don't know if that's a word discord has announced it will be changing its current username system

16:24.920 --> 16:29.000
Which uses a four-digit tag to differentiate users with the same name

16:29.280 --> 16:35.760
This likely means that many users will have to change their user names due to possible duplication and

16:36.520 --> 16:41.240
Okay, in fairness. This is another thing that is a little bit confusing about the four-digit

16:42.040 --> 16:43.880
numbers is that

16:43.880 --> 16:50.720
when you are searching for someone if you don't have their digits it can bring up a lot of garbage results and

16:51.600 --> 16:53.600
That's that's valid

16:53.760 --> 17:01.160
The company will prioritize long-time users in line for name changes and users will still be able to use a non

17:01.160 --> 17:04.400
Unique screen name in addition to their username

17:04.760 --> 17:11.440
Discord noted that while the original system was created to allow users to use whatever name they wanted the tag system was often

17:11.880 --> 17:18.640
Too complicated or obscure to remember causing confusion and unnecessarily difficult unnecessary

17:18.960 --> 17:20.960
difficulty finding other users

17:22.080 --> 17:27.960
Now this is huge. This is a really important note in our notes here, of course

17:28.400 --> 17:33.440
Many current discord users do not necessarily want to be easy to find

17:34.400 --> 17:36.000
this is

17:36.000 --> 17:39.480
So huge in on the on the one hand

17:39.480 --> 17:42.800
I can see how people having mr. Beast

17:43.440 --> 17:44.680
Hashtag

17:44.680 --> 17:49.080
Whatever random numbers can lead to impersonation on the platform

17:49.080 --> 17:53.560
I can see how that would be a concern on the other hand for the real mr.

17:53.560 --> 17:58.200
Beast if he just wants his discord username to be mr. Beast and

17:59.080 --> 18:01.560
Not really worry about people finding him that easily

18:02.240 --> 18:05.240
then he can just be missed at mr. Beast and

18:05.880 --> 18:11.560
Only people who know the correct four digits are going to be able to add him unless they want to just try to add every mr.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.960
Beast and I can tell you if you randomly add Jimmy on discord

18:14.960 --> 18:20.160
He's not gonna add you in fact. I think I had to ping him like three or four times via other means

18:23.960 --> 18:30.120
Another reason for the change is to make discord's username system more similar to what users are already familiar with

18:30.560 --> 18:34.280
Namely from other social networks, especially Twitter

18:35.200 --> 18:40.000
So our discussion question here because I think I've done all the talking and Luke has

18:40.360 --> 18:46.680
Not really contributed his thoughts too much is notable is the advantage of becoming more like other social platforms here

18:46.680 --> 18:48.680
Is this just them chasing?

18:49.080 --> 18:56.720
broader user base so that they can continue justifying outside investment by showing growth or what are we looking at here exactly I

18:57.240 --> 18:59.240
Think honestly, ooh

19:01.320 --> 19:05.080
What would you do with discord if you owned discord

19:05.080 --> 19:10.780
I would figure out how to just make it profitable month over month and I would enjoy just

19:11.520 --> 19:17.960
Being the top voice chat thing for gamers and a lot of non gamers on the entire internet

19:17.960 --> 19:23.160
I think that if I had to try to expand outside of the gaming crowd

19:23.800 --> 19:32.440
There is there are much lower-hanging fruit or rather much more important steps that I could take than changing our username system

19:32.440 --> 19:36.520
And what I would probably want to do is I would probably want to fork the platform

19:37.720 --> 19:44.800
So I would take I would take discord as it is and then I would leave it pretty much as it is with

19:45.040 --> 19:50.960
Meme loading screens and silly cute little pig characters or whatever they are

19:52.720 --> 19:56.840
And I would I would leave a well-established username system

19:57.520 --> 20:02.280
You know all the all the cool things that are great about discord streamer mode stuff like that

20:02.280 --> 20:09.940
I would leave that exactly as it is and then I would take all of the underlying code all the back end and I would

20:10.020 --> 20:11.620
re-skin it as

20:11.620 --> 20:18.700
discord pro or probably just something else entirely and I'd create a professional product that is more designed for

20:19.340 --> 20:25.380
You know getting your grandma set up on so something a little bit more streamlined where I would I would borrow from you know

20:25.380 --> 20:30.860
Maybe the earlier days of of skype for example in terms of functionality and in terms of interface

20:30.900 --> 20:36.060
But have the whole thing run on the same back on the same back end because they've done a great job

20:36.620 --> 20:38.620
Discord is almost never down

20:39.100 --> 20:44.100
Right the voice quality is really good considering that it's a free service

20:44.340 --> 20:49.460
That's another thing is when I create my my premium or my professional product or whatever else it is

20:49.540 --> 20:54.860
You know, I'd want to figure out how to make it paid in some way. I'd want to try and generate revenue from it

20:55.540 --> 20:57.020
but like

20:57.020 --> 21:01.060
Man that the way that you can screen share on discord just with very low latency

21:01.820 --> 21:08.100
Super cool. I mean it'd be great for all kinds of other uses be it business meetings or calling overseas relatives or wherever

21:08.300 --> 21:11.700
It's just a great voice. I honestly find it a lot more

21:12.420 --> 21:18.900
Generally usable than something like Slack or teams, but it lacks some specific like team-based

21:19.900 --> 21:25.220
features so like yeah, if they had more of a bit of a feature rollout for

21:26.260 --> 21:32.140
Mostly managing users sure in a corporate sense, but other than that like the channel creation

21:32.140 --> 21:34.380
I prefer discord's channel creation

21:34.860 --> 21:39.900
And category creation compared to teams or so yeah by a lot. Yep

21:39.900 --> 21:45.900
Like okay, so you're you're upset about teams on Slack. I can't create categories for people

21:46.580 --> 21:54.100
Really? I can I can make private channels so they don't see them and then I can invite specific teams or specific people to the private

21:54.100 --> 21:59.740
Channels so other than that tedious for no reason. Yes, so as an admin you can't just say hey, hey

21:59.740 --> 22:03.860
I've organized everything on front end. I put you all in here

22:04.380 --> 22:08.620
So you can't do a certain degree if you make like every single channel private

22:09.140 --> 22:14.900
Yeah, and then you only invite certain teams right if you just want to have the channels and it's just in a channel list

22:15.020 --> 22:19.660
And then you want to go okay you you and you you you and you then no matter what?

22:19.660 --> 22:21.820
It's just a category called channels

22:21.820 --> 22:27.460
and it's all the dump of all the channels that you're in and then you as the individual user need to create categories and

22:28.260 --> 22:32.860
Sort them like that. Maybe someone has found a way around this the last time

22:34.420 --> 22:36.420
The last time that I

22:36.660 --> 22:41.420
Tried to figure this out the official answer online was like yeah, it's up to the individual user

22:41.420 --> 22:46.460
It's great. Everyone can organize it the way they want. I'm like no no no one has ever asked for that

22:47.380 --> 22:54.140
Well, no users might the problem is and I'm sure that Luke and Dan can speak to this

22:55.540 --> 22:59.340
Users will not organize it well. Yeah, they will do it wrong

22:59.340 --> 23:06.740
No offense users, but I know that you guys have experienced people coming up with their own systems for organizing passwords

23:06.740 --> 23:09.140
For example as you've been going through and doing the audit

23:09.620 --> 23:11.620
Did they do a good job?

23:12.180 --> 23:14.180
No

23:15.020 --> 23:18.700
Not even slightly there's so it's actually stunning like

23:19.260 --> 23:24.540
How many individual days go by where there is at least one thing that we find that is just like

23:25.060 --> 23:27.060
Holy crap

23:27.660 --> 23:29.660
How did this possibly happen

23:30.340 --> 23:36.580
It's it's kind of it's kind of wild and we love our team world-class. I feel world class

23:36.580 --> 23:42.780
I feel and I could be completely wrong and maybe I'm a big dumb dumb. I feel like it's a PM

23:43.180 --> 23:45.180
That's just trying to make a splash

23:46.620 --> 23:53.340
Really the dislike thing. What's the point? Hmm. Does anyone really complain about the numbers? I

23:53.780 --> 23:54.900
I

23:54.900 --> 24:01.460
Found it confusing at first and they did say there the argument that I saw I don't know if it was technically from them or not

24:01.460 --> 24:03.540
So I shouldn't say they did say

24:03.540 --> 24:10.580
But the argument that I saw was that they are trying to fall in line with the average setup that other platforms do which seems mostly

24:11.100 --> 24:16.300
True that is mostly what other platforms do right? I think sort of I don't think Facebook has an app and

24:17.300 --> 24:22.220
And Facebook is yeah, like an app username. Okay to be completely honest

24:22.220 --> 24:25.500
I didn't even realize they were adding the app at the front. Yeah, that is weird

24:25.500 --> 24:31.580
I meant like the the number system after the name. Yeah, that's odd seems completely unnecessary. Yeah

24:32.660 --> 24:35.420
Man displaying that all the time is just gonna look so stupid

24:36.260 --> 24:41.500
It looks stupid on Twitter. It always looked stupid on Twitter. We just got used to it

24:41.700 --> 24:45.540
So we're adopting an arbitrary

24:46.580 --> 24:47.740
meaningless

24:47.740 --> 24:49.260
symbol thing

24:49.260 --> 24:51.260
To replace our arbitrary

24:52.100 --> 24:55.200
Meaningless number thing that goes along with your username

24:56.540 --> 25:02.540
Why wow, I'm so much more against this now. I knew you're talking about the ad earlier

25:02.540 --> 25:04.540
But I thought you're just like off topic. No

25:04.780 --> 25:06.780
Wow, why?

25:07.780 --> 25:14.620
It's it's useless it doesn't it doesn't provide any value if every single user has it

25:14.620 --> 25:16.780
Yeah, then what's the point? This is this is great

25:16.780 --> 25:22.580
So people are saying look the handles are going to be hidden in the same way that the the numbers are now

25:22.580 --> 25:25.340
Yeah, you're gonna show you display name which is fine

25:26.340 --> 25:32.300
Because it is gonna just not matter now in the same way that it just didn't matter already and

25:33.140 --> 25:35.140
the amount of just

25:35.300 --> 25:36.660
Man

25:36.660 --> 25:41.180
Remember when we migrated float plane from the forum to the dedicated site? Yes

25:42.700 --> 25:46.100
Asking a user to go into their account and do

25:46.700 --> 25:50.780
Anything you might as well ask them to move the moon for you

25:50.780 --> 25:54.460
And I don't mean that users are bad people or they're lazy

25:54.460 --> 26:01.580
I just mean they have a life and they have other stuff to do and for a lot of people going in and

26:01.940 --> 26:09.620
Micromanaging their profile and picking usernames is not real high up on their list of cool fun things that I want to do when I've got

26:09.700 --> 26:15.700
You know 45 minutes of earned game time because I played piano and it's time to play games

26:15.700 --> 26:20.780
That's not real high up on their list of what they want to do. They want to open their game and start playing

26:22.540 --> 26:26.260
I'm gonna build this tree hut in Minecraft, okay

26:26.260 --> 26:29.660
I played an hour and 45 minutes or whatever. What did you say?

26:29.700 --> 26:33.260
You have you have 45 minutes game time, so I played an hour and a half of piano. I

26:34.460 --> 26:36.460
Deserve to cut this tree down

26:37.900 --> 26:46.180
With Bob yeah, so it's really it's really frustrating. It's just kind of stupid and I I don't I don't I don't understand

26:46.180 --> 26:48.180
Why and I think we can just move on

26:48.180 --> 26:51.220
Things I do understand why this is exciting

26:51.860 --> 26:57.380
OBS just added AV one support for YouTube live streams. This is super cool

26:57.860 --> 27:01.660
Happening want to talk us through this one. Yeah, so OBS studios

27:02.140 --> 27:09.860
29.1 update supports streaming to YouTube using the AV one encoder stream with AV one results in boosted image quality and

27:10.260 --> 27:11.740
bit rate

27:11.740 --> 27:13.740
that can be reduced by up to

27:14.900 --> 27:19.380
And bit rate that can be reduced by up to 40% without sacrificing image quality

27:19.380 --> 27:20.700
Yeah, so you can kind of pick one

27:20.700 --> 27:24.820
Yeah, you can keep your bit rate the same and have better image quality

27:24.820 --> 27:29.980
Or you can lower your bit rate which could save you on bandwidth costs or data cat well

27:29.980 --> 27:31.260
Those are the same thing

27:31.260 --> 27:37.820
Could also make it easier for your viewers to watch it original quality. I guess I'm trying to think of that's that's more reverting to

27:37.820 --> 27:40.940
The previous one where you're you're gaining more quality, right?

27:40.940 --> 27:45.060
And with I think the main way this is going to be used which is a massive win is

27:45.660 --> 27:47.660
To achieve the same amount

27:48.180 --> 27:53.340
But with way less bandwidth. Yeah, and that's that okay the cynic in me will go

27:53.700 --> 27:56.700
Wow good a win for Amazon

27:57.500 --> 28:04.260
I'm sure glad that they can save money on all these twitch streams, but this is actually a W for everybody. Yeah

28:05.260 --> 28:07.260
unnecessary internet bits

28:08.100 --> 28:10.100
unnecessary traffic is

28:10.100 --> 28:16.300
Harmful for absolutely everyone involved it clogs up the pipes or tubes the tubes

28:16.300 --> 28:21.980
Excuse me, it's just a series of no, but it as much as that go in your tubes is a stupid analogy

28:21.980 --> 28:24.340
And the internet is not a series of tubes

28:25.420 --> 28:33.620
It's actually not entirely wrong either. Yeah, the more data that you have unnecessarily taking up your switching capacity

28:34.660 --> 28:39.620
The less data you can deliver more quickly for everything else

28:39.860 --> 28:46.860
Yeah, this is a win all around this is good and it's gonna cost you maybe a little bit in terms of

28:47.220 --> 28:49.220
encoding and decoding

28:49.260 --> 28:53.060
Power consumption that's I think maybe the the the worst

28:54.260 --> 29:00.340
Possible outcome of this but as AV1 hardware and code and decode becomes far more prevalent over

29:00.340 --> 29:03.980
I'd say probably the next two years or so especially good implementations

29:03.980 --> 29:09.660
It's gonna be like kind of on any new product within about the next 24 months. I would guess

29:10.140 --> 29:12.300
This is gonna be freaking awesome

29:12.300 --> 29:18.300
I mean, we've tested it fairly extensively especially when Intel released their arc graphics cards and we found out

29:18.300 --> 29:21.420
Hey, they're the first ones to deliver a next gen

29:22.060 --> 29:26.860
GPU with AV1 encoding. How does this work? The AV1 encoding felt next gen

29:26.860 --> 29:32.540
No, no other part of the card necessarily did but the AV1 coding a hundred percent did a hundred percent

29:33.220 --> 29:39.540
They totally delivered there another sign in favor of AV1 approaching mass adoption is that mat rocks video

29:39.620 --> 29:46.380
Whose graphics cards are widely used for workstations video walls and digital signage has released a new series of Luma

29:46.500 --> 29:48.740
Graphics cards powered by Intel's alchemist

29:49.300 --> 29:56.660
We're just talking about this architecture, which includes Intel's excellent AV1 transcoding ability makes sense

29:56.900 --> 29:59.300
Twitch does not currently support AV1

30:00.260 --> 30:04.460
But I bet on it coming Dave. I mean I

30:05.060 --> 30:07.620
Guess they had that source code leak a while back

30:07.620 --> 30:11.140
I I I we could we could probably check and see if they're

30:11.860 --> 30:17.540
AV1 was not very flavor the month if we were unethical folks who would download the twitch source code leak

30:17.540 --> 30:24.100
Which I am not saying we are we could look at it and we could see if maybe they had some early work on AV1 or something

30:24.100 --> 30:27.940
Like that that they were that they were looking into but yeah, you don't want to you don't want to kick that business

30:27.940 --> 30:33.700
They were definitely working on it at the time. I mean if if not twitch then certainly Amazon

30:33.700 --> 30:39.060
There's no way that folks like the the team that's working on prime prime video or Netflix

30:39.780 --> 30:43.940
Or YouTube there's no way that they haven't been working on AV1 because for years

30:44.140 --> 30:46.140
They've been working away at this standard

30:46.540 --> 30:51.460
Working on what the hardware and code and decode implementations will look like bringing it to maturity

30:52.060 --> 30:58.900
This whole process takes like just with how big the industry is and how slow moving it is now it can take ten years

30:58.900 --> 31:02.860
I mean how long have we been trying to move on from h.264?

31:03.580 --> 31:11.340
Because HEVC was one attempt, but the licensing fees and I know there's been there's been other attempts as well a huge part

31:11.340 --> 31:14.060
Of the problem has ended up being licensing multiple times

31:14.180 --> 31:20.260
Whereas AV1 is a game changer because my understanding is it costs nothing to implement

31:20.260 --> 31:24.340
It still doesn't have the same licensing setup as h.264

31:24.340 --> 31:29.940
I don't know all the intricate details of the differences between them, but I know it's not like identical

31:29.940 --> 31:32.540
Hold on there might be a fee. Let me just have a look here

31:33.140 --> 31:37.540
royalty-free standards are not free of cost and this is blah blah blah blah, okay, so

31:38.020 --> 31:45.180
What I do know is that it's much more appealing and therefore is seeing much broader adoption than HEVC

31:45.180 --> 31:49.420
I know when I was when I was hanging out down at NASA, which is one of the coolest things to say ever

31:49.420 --> 31:52.380
I was talking to one of their tech people about

31:53.180 --> 31:57.140
Video compression encoding transferring data all the different complications

31:57.140 --> 32:02.100
They have around that going around the dark side of the moon going to Mars the data complications of those different situations

32:02.140 --> 32:08.060
And I asked what about AV1 and yeah, they currently use h.264 and

32:08.740 --> 32:12.580
They would love to use AV1, but they're concerned about licensing issues. Oh

32:13.340 --> 32:16.940
Interesting even even at that level concerned about licensing issues

32:19.620 --> 32:21.620
Kind of sucks it would help them a lot

32:21.780 --> 32:27.380
Because the amount of stuff that they have to send back and forth and the fixed pipe that they have is is a very difficult

32:28.180 --> 32:30.180
equation for them

32:30.220 --> 32:36.460
So AV1 apparently has royalty-free licensing, but that doesn't necessarily mean that there is no cost

32:37.580 --> 32:41.420
So yeah, we'll have to we'll have to get you guys an update on that because I'm actually kind of interested

32:41.660 --> 32:47.460
Squid hominid over on float playing chat is saying it'll be a game changer for twitch once they add AV1 because right now

32:47.660 --> 32:54.420
You're hard capped at six megabit per second and you aren't guaranteed transcoding. So unless you're a prominent streamer

32:56.180 --> 32:58.180
Basically the platform has kind of

32:59.060 --> 33:05.740
Self-selected itself to be limited to you know two and a half to three megabytes per megabit per second streams

33:06.020 --> 33:12.740
Unless you're a big deal on the platform already which hurts discoverability of small creators because why are you gonna tune in and watch?

33:12.740 --> 33:14.740
Someone playing this game unless they have an absolutely

33:15.220 --> 33:20.500
Electric personality why are you gonna tune in and watch someone play this game at low crap tastic quality?

33:20.500 --> 33:26.420
When you can tune into one of the big streamers and it can look freakin awesome and probably sound better, too

33:26.420 --> 33:28.780
I mean the kinds of compromises you have to make to do

33:29.620 --> 33:33.620
To stream at two and a half three megabit per second or pretty pretty yucky

33:34.180 --> 33:40.300
AV1 will be able to do 1080p at that and still look pretty decent. I'm excited. This is freakin awesome

33:41.780 --> 33:43.780
Yeah

33:43.820 --> 33:45.820
So

33:48.100 --> 33:50.100
When float playing support it

33:51.460 --> 33:55.940
We'll support it eventually it's not in the cards right now. We have some pretty monster

33:57.020 --> 33:59.260
Ben with caps on our live streaming the last time I checked

34:01.180 --> 34:03.180
So

34:03.340 --> 34:05.780
Yeah, I don't know we're not working on it

34:09.460 --> 34:11.460
We will work on it eventually

34:11.700 --> 34:15.700
We are not working on it right now. We got all this stuff to do now. It's the point in the show

34:15.700 --> 34:18.900
There is there is I'm gonna hijack this. No, you want to throw me out of the bus

34:18.900 --> 34:22.740
I'm gonna I'm gonna crawl out of this bus there have been there's no bus

34:22.740 --> 34:26.820
There has been a ton of updates on the site might not work right now

34:28.220 --> 34:30.460
Because one of the updates that we pushed yesterday

34:31.260 --> 34:32.420
apparently

34:32.420 --> 34:34.420
Borked something with live streaming

34:34.980 --> 34:40.020
But we are working on there's been a yeah, it was it was working a second

34:40.020 --> 34:45.740
We know exactly what's wrong and we'll have it fixed very soon. Can we show some cool stuff though? I mean if it works

34:45.740 --> 34:47.980
Yeah, so there's there's sub channels

34:47.980 --> 34:52.500
So if you expand to the sidebar you can collapse the sidebar that's one thing but there's sub channels now

34:52.740 --> 34:57.500
So to click the little arrow down the bottom left hand corner, which the users can't see because it's hidden behind us

34:57.500 --> 34:59.740
Oh, you got a wide in the screen. There we go

34:59.740 --> 35:04.020
So you can see all the different sub channels with their different names and stuff if you click on there

35:04.020 --> 35:08.660
You get to see Linus's meme face and this is all the flow plain exclusives a bunch of people asked for this

35:08.660 --> 35:11.100
So we have now added it. You can see the red bar at the bottom screen

35:11.100 --> 35:16.660
We tried to go with like a float plane light blue, but it just didn't work. You can like never see it

35:16.660 --> 35:22.620
So wait, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. We have resume now. Yeah, so this will pick up where I left off

35:22.780 --> 35:24.740
I mean if it

35:24.740 --> 35:32.180
Are we wow, I don't think we've been this broken in a long time. Yeah, but I mean like I said we know we know what's wrong

35:33.180 --> 35:36.380
So what what what set it off was us going live? Ah

35:37.340 --> 35:39.340
You know, what's really funny Luke?

35:40.700 --> 35:47.140
Do you remember when I popped into the float plane aquarium I think yesterday and you guys were telling me

35:47.140 --> 35:50.780
Yeah, we pushed everything that we talked about in our meeting yesterday. It's all live

35:50.780 --> 35:57.420
And I was like that seems like a really weird thing to do on a Thursday afternoon heading into the weekend and you guys were like

36:00.020 --> 36:05.900
Do you remember that yeah, we remember that when's a good day to push, you know Monday. No

36:06.300 --> 36:13.060
Don't know how you guys normally push Friday just before wancho. I mean, we don't talk about it. Okay, any who

36:13.620 --> 36:19.900
Resume works by the way. We've got some great exclusives on there now. We've got the extras from the NCI accessor PC build

36:20.220 --> 36:23.300
We've got their first time series with Sarah now

36:23.300 --> 36:28.940
So where people kind of talk about their early days in the company and react to their first time on camera

36:28.940 --> 36:33.040
I've watched a few of those. Yeah, we've got I think that few is all there is there's Nick Colton

36:33.040 --> 36:39.180
They're very new. Yeah, it's a really good idea for a series. I've also got a little bit of early access going on right now

36:39.180 --> 36:41.180
I took my PC to geek squad

36:42.780 --> 36:47.020
It looks like we've already fixed it for the main site and the beta site will figure itself out soon

36:47.100 --> 36:51.500
So yeah, they're on it. They'll fix it. It's all right cool. So there's another really cool thing though

36:51.740 --> 36:53.740
If I go into my settings

36:54.060 --> 36:58.540
I can change my notifications for each individual subject per channel now

36:59.100 --> 37:01.100
Yeah, it could so

37:01.340 --> 37:04.620
There's a there's also the include email notifications. That's going to change

37:04.700 --> 37:09.260
We're going to turn email into more of like a digest system where you get an email

37:09.260 --> 37:13.340
This is going to be user selectable you get an email either once a day or once a week

37:14.060 --> 37:17.500
With like all of the notifications that would have happened within that time window

37:17.820 --> 37:19.980
The reason why we want to switch to that is just because

37:20.620 --> 37:27.100
Some people might be getting a lot of notifications and getting a ton of email is actually like super annoying

37:27.740 --> 37:29.740
So 100 yeah, we're doing that

37:30.300 --> 37:34.140
But yeah, so if you don't like if you're like, no, I like mac address and tech news

37:34.140 --> 37:39.260
I don't want anything else. So you can turn off everything else. Just leave those on do whatever you want. No problem

37:39.500 --> 37:42.780
And then how does this work? I can change my subscription tier now, right?

37:43.020 --> 37:47.980
So if you click on the channel again, I believe you can do it from here, but you have granted subscriptions

37:47.980 --> 37:52.380
So it's not going to show but if you if you click on the channel again. Yeah, mm-hmm if it works

37:52.620 --> 37:54.620
Uh, click manage subscription over there. Mm-hmm

37:55.340 --> 37:58.220
And then you can click subscribe on the tiers that you don't have

37:59.260 --> 38:01.340
um, oh, okay, and then

38:03.580 --> 38:08.700
Okay, yeah, it's not going to show for me because you have granted subscriptions because this is my channel. Yeah

38:08.860 --> 38:14.860
Yeah, anyway. Oh that also makes sense. Yeah, uh, but yeah, you can you can subscribe you can change your your subscriptions through there

38:14.940 --> 38:20.860
So yeah, there's been we pushed the the list of things that we pushed this last week is an entire page long

38:21.100 --> 38:26.300
Yeah, uh making up for lost time. Yeah a little bit. So I mean, yeah, maybe we we

38:26.860 --> 38:31.900
Flew a little close to the sun broke a little thing in there. Um, we didn't test live streaming

38:31.900 --> 38:34.620
I guess which was a bit of a a bit of a miss

38:35.340 --> 38:37.660
But it's it is okay. They are on it

38:37.740 --> 38:41.580
It's going to be fixed soon and honestly the beta site feels amazing right now

38:41.580 --> 38:43.900
If you want to use it go to the main one because the beta site's broken

38:44.060 --> 38:50.140
But the beta fight site feels so good that beta fight that sounds like a great speaking of live streams

38:50.220 --> 38:53.340
I would watch that that's what the fish do. No, not the fish. I'm talking like

38:59.340 --> 39:01.340
Oh my god, um

39:01.900 --> 39:04.220
The the beta site feels great. Uh, one of our

39:05.260 --> 39:09.660
Small issues that we had that we kind of resolved last night jumped in a call with dankpods

39:09.900 --> 39:15.900
Because he uses safari for everything and as far as I can tell he is the only user on the platform that uses safari

39:16.060 --> 39:18.940
So he's very useful for bug testing safari

39:19.260 --> 39:24.380
Um, great. So we jumped on a call with him just to like make sure everything was all good. Um,

39:25.180 --> 39:28.060
And uh, he also didn't live stream so it was

39:28.620 --> 39:30.620
Um, got it

39:30.620 --> 39:34.220
But yeah, we're we have we're going to spend like the next week or so

39:34.780 --> 39:39.100
Uh, kind of bug testing these types of things and fixing stuff and then probably

39:39.500 --> 39:44.140
Hopefully be ready to send it after that. But yeah, fantastic

39:45.180 --> 39:48.860
Now it's the point in the show where we explain about merch messages

39:49.020 --> 39:56.700
If you guys want to interact with the show, don't send a super chat. Don't send a twitch bit or butt or whatever just

39:57.500 --> 40:01.980
Send a merch message that way instead of just throwing money into the ether you can

40:03.100 --> 40:06.780
You know have uh, have your message pop up in the bottom down here or

40:07.180 --> 40:14.220
Maybe dan will curate it for us to talk about later on the show when show after dark or you know, maybe it'll just get

40:14.700 --> 40:20.140
Not shown at all because you put an inappropriate word in it and he had to block it. He had to block you

40:20.220 --> 40:22.780
I mean it does that that definitely does happen

40:23.100 --> 40:25.980
So the way to send a merch message is you just go to lttstore.com

40:26.060 --> 40:30.060
You check out any of the great products over there including some of our new arrivals

40:30.540 --> 40:32.780
And in the checkout you will have the option

40:33.340 --> 40:36.700
To send a merch message. What do you want to see first today?

40:37.100 --> 40:40.860
Do you want to see the new t-shirt designs that are actually very exciting and cool?

40:40.940 --> 40:44.540
And we can finally launch because our printer is back up and running

40:45.020 --> 40:52.380
Or do you want to see the new mouse pad called the cyber stats desk pad cyber stats cyber stats

40:52.380 --> 40:57.900
I was gonna say t-shirt because I always love the t-shirts, but cyber stats sound super cool

40:57.900 --> 41:01.420
So let's check that out. All right. Let's save the most exciting for luke for last

41:04.780 --> 41:11.420
Why do I even ask him anything when I'm just gonna do the opposite because otherwise I wouldn't know what he doesn't want

41:15.020 --> 41:17.500
So we've got three new designs

41:17.500 --> 41:21.980
I'm just gonna head to the store right now because I don't know what creative fun names we have for them

41:23.180 --> 41:26.940
Here they are. Ah, yes. We have a fan t-shirt

41:28.140 --> 41:31.340
Our hardware hardware inspired series is back

41:31.900 --> 41:33.100
So it's kind of a fan

41:33.100 --> 41:40.940
But also there's like kind of a planetary thing going on and these are all printed on our blanks, which are flipping awesome

41:41.340 --> 41:43.340
We've also got

41:44.940 --> 41:46.940
Ooh a new cpu design

41:47.660 --> 41:53.500
Okay, well that's pretty sick. How if I you know what I probably I probably have seen this

41:53.980 --> 42:00.460
I think I just forget because we probably looked at it first along. Oh, no, this is sensor. Oh, that's right

42:00.620 --> 42:04.060
That's right. Right. Right. Right. This is inspired by like a camera sensor. Yeah, that makes sense

42:04.060 --> 42:07.260
This is the light kind of coming in and hitting it. Yep. Yep. Yep, man

42:07.980 --> 42:12.620
This was designed back when they were still upstairs. They didn't even have their own office yet

42:13.500 --> 42:16.380
And then we've also got the mountain t-shirt

42:17.900 --> 42:19.900
That's

42:20.460 --> 42:24.620
Cool. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not saying there wasn't any Death Star inspiration

42:25.580 --> 42:27.580
I actually just don't know

42:27.580 --> 42:32.620
Now let's talk about the cyber stats desk pad. It's only available in one size

42:32.700 --> 42:35.980
So it's not quite the same as all of our uh, well

42:35.980 --> 42:39.580
I shouldn't say all of our as some of our other ones that are available in a wide variety of sizes

42:40.220 --> 42:42.540
But it's pretty cute

42:43.100 --> 42:48.220
It is chock full of interesting stats about the ltt channel

42:48.940 --> 42:53.340
So here if you want to take a side I can point out some of the some of the things

42:54.060 --> 42:59.100
Uh, this right here, I believe is our oh crap

42:59.980 --> 43:01.980
Uh, Sarah told me all of this

43:03.020 --> 43:04.540
Oh, no

43:04.540 --> 43:09.180
Now I forget. Oh, no, it's not labeled. Oh crap. Well

43:10.060 --> 43:12.940
Good luck me. I guess I'm gonna get everything wrong

43:13.820 --> 43:15.660
uh, first up

43:15.660 --> 43:17.660
I think this is

43:17.660 --> 43:18.460
um

43:18.460 --> 43:21.100
Where people tune in from by geography

43:21.580 --> 43:23.820
And I want to say this is the us

43:24.540 --> 43:30.300
And then this is probably like canada great britain. So this is like all the other countries. Yes. Yes location

43:30.620 --> 43:32.620
There's a little location thing here

43:32.780 --> 43:34.460
Uh, this

43:34.460 --> 43:38.060
Is I believe the waveform of the ltt

43:40.140 --> 43:42.140
Intro song

43:42.620 --> 43:47.660
Oh, oh, what just oh luke dang it luke. Okay. We've got the wan show logo ltt logo

43:48.060 --> 43:53.340
We've got uh all the items from the classic intro. Nice. We've got

43:53.900 --> 43:59.580
Oh, no, what's the chart? What is that? Oh crap. Why didn't we put this on the product page? I have no idea

44:00.060 --> 44:02.060
Um, I think this

44:02.700 --> 44:09.020
Oh, no, I don't know this cure code though super cool. You go to the latest or yeah luke luke just tried it

44:09.260 --> 44:12.460
It goes to the latest video that we uploaded to ltt

44:13.340 --> 44:20.060
Floop I made that it was pretty cool. Oh, did they okay? That's very very very sweet. And unfortunately, I forget everything else

44:22.220 --> 44:25.740
It should it's we should put it on the product page. Yeah, we should put that on the product page

44:25.900 --> 44:31.660
We'll do that. Yeah, you guys will get the you guys will get the cool backstory for anyway, sarah designed that and uh, super cute

44:31.820 --> 44:33.820
That's sweet

44:35.580 --> 44:37.900
All right, why don't we go ahead and uh

44:38.700 --> 44:41.820
Start our next. Oh, right. We're supposed to do a couple of merge messages dan

44:42.300 --> 44:45.500
You want to hit us with a couple? Sure. First one here is from dav

44:45.820 --> 44:52.060
Hi dll big fan of your show the channels and flow plane with the advent of the rog ally

44:52.220 --> 44:57.660
What other big tech companies do you think are going to throw their hat in the ring of handheld gaming pcs?

45:00.140 --> 45:06.460
Well, the second asoost does anything gigabyte and msi will do it so that will certainly happen

45:07.420 --> 45:08.380
um

45:08.380 --> 45:13.260
Man other than that, I would be surprised if delay lee and wear didn't have a product like this

45:13.340 --> 45:15.580
I mean they showed one off ages ago

45:16.140 --> 45:22.060
It's it's for them. It wouldn't even be coming out of nowhere. Have you called them that before? Yeah delay lee and wear

45:22.140 --> 45:27.980
Yeah, I don't think I've heard that was great. I don't think I came up with it. Oh really? Yeah, I think that's a thing

45:28.860 --> 45:32.540
First time for me as well delay lee and wear. I like that a lot. I don't know why

45:33.100 --> 45:38.700
Oh, man. Okay. Yeah, I I this honestly for a while. I've been expecting it from delay lee and wear

45:39.020 --> 45:41.500
Um, but I think they might be kind of late

45:42.540 --> 45:44.540
But it will probably be like

45:44.780 --> 45:49.500
Solid but late. Yeah, because when when did they show that thing off?

45:50.540 --> 45:54.460
Alienware turned to gaming. Yeah, here's uh, here's a video from the verge

45:55.020 --> 46:01.580
From over three years ago ces 2020 where they did a like a like a nintendo switch

46:01.900 --> 46:02.940
sort of

46:02.940 --> 46:04.940
form factor gaming pc

46:05.100 --> 46:07.100
And then alienware concept

46:07.420 --> 46:08.300
nicks

46:08.300 --> 46:11.180
They apparently did it again at ces 2022

46:11.900 --> 46:19.260
No, what is this? No, no, that's that's that's something else entirely. So no, yeah, it's that 2022 it was the ufo concept

46:19.900 --> 46:23.900
So if del if del alienware did it then that wouldn't surprise me at all

46:24.300 --> 46:31.500
And then if they do it, you know, I think other tier ones like I would be very surprised if the acers and lenovo

46:31.580 --> 46:36.060
legions of the world didn't come in and try and compete in the space because the thing is

46:37.260 --> 46:39.660
I'm actually surprised it's taken this long

46:40.380 --> 46:42.380
If you kind of get what I mean

46:42.860 --> 46:46.380
Because if these companies can engineer a laptop

46:47.100 --> 46:49.260
Yeah, what's the difference?

46:50.860 --> 46:53.580
It's a lot of like stuff to jam in there

46:54.060 --> 47:00.460
It is but it also isn't have you opened up a chromebook recently. Yeah, but that's a chromebook

47:00.460 --> 47:02.460
It's not like a this is a chromebook

47:03.900 --> 47:05.900
The whole thing's integrated

47:05.980 --> 47:09.900
The cpu the gpu, but it's more powerful. It's an soc

47:11.580 --> 47:15.900
Well powerful from what standpoint right because we're talking we're talking like 30 watts

47:17.180 --> 47:19.180
Oh, wow, jeez. Yeah, it's nothing

47:20.060 --> 47:24.860
So you have as long as you sort of fundamentally understand cooling

47:24.860 --> 47:28.700
No, but I guess what I'm trying to say is we're talking about timeline like how did it happen this late?

47:28.940 --> 47:31.580
But like yeah technological advancement

47:32.140 --> 47:37.340
Sure, I mean that's fair enough, but I just mean why are why are they getting blindsided by the ally?

47:37.820 --> 47:41.340
Why weren't they just working on the ally is maybe a little bit surprising to me

47:41.500 --> 47:47.260
The steam deck is not because as we've talked about before it's heavily subsidized by steam game sales

47:47.820 --> 47:50.700
So you can kind of make it in an expensive way

47:51.420 --> 47:55.980
And then not very it's it's like how they used to lose money selling consoles apparently they still are

47:56.700 --> 47:57.340
Really?

47:57.340 --> 48:02.620
Yeah, I doubt the ps5 is losing money, but I I'd be surprised if they're making money on xbox series s

48:02.700 --> 48:05.020
What would be the point in losing money on a ps5?

48:05.340 --> 48:13.340
Um sell more games. I mean same as same as it was when they were sold out at stores for three years or something like

48:15.340 --> 48:17.340
I don't know whatever

48:17.500 --> 48:19.500
But yeah, I

48:20.220 --> 48:23.900
I don't know. I I'm surprised at the I feel like I'm almost the opposite

48:24.460 --> 48:28.300
I'm not surprised that the other ones are so late. I'm surprised the ally is so early

48:29.020 --> 48:29.900
Really?

48:29.900 --> 48:33.260
Oh, because I didn't expect another competitor to steam deck

48:33.900 --> 48:38.380
That is as good as the ally seems to be this fast. That was very surprising to me

48:38.700 --> 48:43.180
Well, the steam deck was already a generation behind for cpu tech

48:43.740 --> 48:48.460
And our dna3 was already on the horizon for desktop gpus

48:48.700 --> 48:53.900
So we knew that architecturally amd had already laid the ground. No, I get that. It's possible

48:53.900 --> 48:56.460
I'm just surprised that they actually reacted that quickly. I guess

48:57.580 --> 49:00.620
Because this is like a whole new product segment all this kind of stuff

49:00.620 --> 49:05.340
Yeah, but it's not that fast like that's the thing. I guess I'm kind of trying to say is how long go to the steam deck launch

49:05.500 --> 49:07.500
Is this like a year a year or more

49:08.140 --> 49:12.620
Yeah, because uh about a year. I think was when they started showing it one year to

49:13.500 --> 49:18.300
Create an entirely new product. Well, that's the thing with manufacturing and everything like

49:18.460 --> 49:23.420
Delalienware asus has had their eye on this for quite a while. They've been working on prototypes

49:24.060 --> 49:28.700
On the like in the back room a little over a year older. Yeah, and and the thing is

49:29.500 --> 49:34.780
They're used to working on that product development cycle. That's the thing. Okay. That's the part of the puzzle

49:34.780 --> 49:39.820
Maybe you're missing here is because intel launches a new generation of cpus every year

49:40.300 --> 49:46.060
So they're iterating start to finish on a product in a year every time already

49:46.220 --> 49:48.780
Yeah, yeah, and they're doing they're doing different manufacturing

49:49.180 --> 49:52.940
Because they're not yeah, yeah, that's fair enough and so any time they put a new

49:53.260 --> 50:00.540
Bring new chassis to market as heck, but these companies I guess are used to dealing with that frame. That's literally their entire job

50:00.940 --> 50:08.220
Is to get some pre production broken ass silicon from intel and amd or whoever else kind of go

50:08.700 --> 50:14.620
Okay, yeah as long as the final product is somewhat within these thermal and power specifications

50:14.620 --> 50:19.020
We're going to start designing around this they do up all the tooling they get the final

50:19.340 --> 50:23.980
They get the final silicon they build these a handful of these things to show at trade shows

50:24.220 --> 50:28.860
And then you know two months later. They're rolling off the mass production lines and they're shipping to customers

50:29.820 --> 50:35.500
That's what they do. So it's kind of mind-blowing to me that msi doesn't have a companion

50:36.060 --> 50:39.900
And gigabyte doesn't have a they would call it supporter, you know

50:40.140 --> 50:44.380
Support support class. Yeah, you know whatever, right?

50:45.180 --> 50:49.260
I don't know and maybe they do maybe they just don't want to tip their hand

50:49.340 --> 50:53.900
maybe they want to see how the ally goes in typical sort of copycat fashion

50:54.460 --> 50:59.420
And you know if it goes really well, then they leapfrog. That's the position. I feel like del is in

51:00.540 --> 51:04.300
I feel like del moves slower on this kind of stuff. Yeah. Yes. Do yeah

51:04.460 --> 51:08.380
No, I know like they're the first with that. They were the first with an OLED gaming monitor

51:09.340 --> 51:11.020
First mover del

51:11.020 --> 51:18.620
Alienware. Yeah, but the like product segment was more stable. They were actually first with an OLED business monitor as well

51:18.700 --> 51:22.780
Way back in the day. That was a disaster that product launch. Okay. Well, that didn't work out

51:22.780 --> 51:25.900
Yeah, I ordered one because I they wouldn't send me a review sample

51:25.900 --> 51:30.380
And I was sure I knew why because it wouldn't get burn in because it was a very early OLED

51:30.780 --> 51:36.780
And so I bought one. I was like, okay, I'll order your stupid 1200 monitor or whatever even though I really don't want one

51:37.420 --> 51:42.460
And it got broken in shipping and in the time between me ordering it and trying to rma it

51:43.020 --> 51:46.940
They discontinued it and wouldn't send me another one. So I think what happened is they probably just

51:47.260 --> 51:50.300
Realized every single one of these things they sold was going to come back

51:50.860 --> 51:57.260
And just scrapped them. That's kind of brutal. Yeah, that's that's what I suspect happened. I've never confirmed that but I'm pretty

51:58.300 --> 52:02.060
Pretty suss. It's pretty suss that whole thing how that went down

52:02.940 --> 52:08.140
Squid hominid and float plane shot said going with the names companion and supporter here is even funnier

52:08.140 --> 52:10.620
If you remember that it was almost called the steam pal

52:13.420 --> 52:17.180
That's pretty good it what I didn't know that actually. Oh my gosh

52:18.460 --> 52:20.940
I'm I'm still pretty surprised anyone was steam deck

52:22.060 --> 52:24.060
With stream deck already existing

52:24.460 --> 52:28.940
Yeah, I think I feel like if anything I accidentally call this steam deck

52:29.580 --> 52:33.420
More than I accidentally call a steam deck a stream deck though. Yeah, so

52:34.300 --> 52:39.420
Valve won. Yeah. Oh, they like immediately won. It's just kind of it's surprising

52:39.900 --> 52:43.500
Because they're so close like companies usually don't like touching that much, you know

52:44.620 --> 52:46.780
All right hit us again. Sure thing

52:47.340 --> 52:50.060
Um, I heart today's video about gs

52:50.540 --> 52:53.740
I started a local repair shop with inspiration from lmg

52:54.140 --> 53:00.780
One thing that surprises me was the amount of audio gear that I see. Are there any markets that you reach that you didn't expect?

53:02.940 --> 53:06.060
Oh, um, you know what not anymore

53:06.620 --> 53:08.620
It definitely used to

53:08.700 --> 53:13.900
But these days if anything, I'm the one telling potential partners that we reach

53:14.620 --> 53:21.900
An audience that you probably don't expect. I remember back when we first got in touch with amd's like enterprise and server

53:22.220 --> 53:24.220
CPU folks. So like epic

53:24.860 --> 53:28.540
They were very hesitant to work with us assuming that everyone that watches

53:29.580 --> 53:33.900
And gamer bros the rest of the channel. Yeah, there's like the gamer gamer kids or whatever

53:34.220 --> 53:39.420
But I mean, I have I have the analytics, right? I have the demographics numbers. I know that's not true

53:39.900 --> 53:44.700
So I basically went okay, so you won't send us a CPU fine. I'll just go buy a cpu. What do I care?

53:45.100 --> 53:48.940
So actually, I don't even think we ended up buying one. I think wendell lent us one or something

53:48.940 --> 53:50.940
We got our hands on one somehow it doesn't matter

53:51.340 --> 53:54.140
The point is we were pretty well connected in worst-case scenario

53:54.220 --> 53:56.220
We open up the purse strings we buy it, right?

53:56.300 --> 54:00.300
And so we made a video that was just like an episode of holy s*** where we we checked out

54:00.380 --> 54:04.460
I think it was a 32 core like the first epic that we covered there's either 32 or 64

54:04.460 --> 54:08.060
It doesn't matter the point is that it absolutely blew up

54:08.860 --> 54:13.180
Definitely registered for them because ever since then

54:13.820 --> 54:16.780
They're pretty down to work with us because I feel like

54:17.580 --> 54:21.740
For and and and it's nothing personal because it's a mistake that anyone could make

54:22.220 --> 54:25.900
If your nose is like this close to the product, right?

54:26.540 --> 54:28.300
You know the strength of it

54:28.300 --> 54:34.860
You know how cool epic is and how disruptive it is from a price to performance to power consumption standpoint

54:35.420 --> 54:41.260
You know all the the advantages and everyone you talk to literally everyone in your life

54:41.660 --> 54:44.300
So your hardware partners your software partners

54:45.100 --> 54:47.100
Your cut your your current customers

54:47.900 --> 54:49.260
Gets it

54:49.260 --> 54:51.900
So you kind of go well everyone must get it then

54:53.260 --> 54:57.820
But the reality is that a lot of people work in that industry

54:58.700 --> 55:00.060
and

55:00.060 --> 55:02.780
You know what maybe just aren't actually that

55:03.420 --> 55:05.420
Excited to learn about cpus

55:05.980 --> 55:09.900
Maybe what they actually are excited about and care about in their spare time

55:10.300 --> 55:15.340
Is wacky cooling experiments that we do or you know, what phone should they buy or

55:16.220 --> 55:18.300
How does not to not to keep bringing them up?

55:18.300 --> 55:23.500
Yeah, one of the things that the nasa guys said was that they get inspiration from watching

55:23.980 --> 55:29.740
You just do random stuff seriously and it inspires them to push the envelope in certain ways. Okay. I take it back

55:29.740 --> 55:35.100
I do I am surprised then but like I I was a little bit too, but there was multiple of them saying

55:35.420 --> 55:39.260
Yeah, and they might not you know, they might not do the exact same thing

55:39.340 --> 55:46.540
Oh, I should certainly hope not but it inspires them to to think in a certain direction or potentially test certain things out and see how well

55:47.260 --> 55:52.620
An implementation or a version of something that you did or maybe even the same thing might work in their environment

55:52.700 --> 55:56.380
That's hilarious. It's actually like really cool. So back to the data center thing though

55:56.540 --> 56:03.660
people are tuning in because they just are excited about technology or or they're excited about some kind of technology and

56:04.620 --> 56:07.180
Oh, holy crap the number of times I've seen this comment

56:07.500 --> 56:12.220
It's so cool to see you guys talking about the thing that I do all the time. I never expected you guys to cover this

56:12.940 --> 56:15.980
Um, this is so cool and I've even seen this one too

56:16.380 --> 56:19.180
Now I can take this to my like purchasing manager and go

56:19.180 --> 56:22.380
Hey, we should really look at this because it's got coverage on this huge tech channel

56:22.460 --> 56:24.460
and you'll often break it down into

56:24.860 --> 56:29.820
Something that that purchasing manager might understand and not just the purchasing manager their manager

56:29.980 --> 56:33.740
Yeah, like there's I forget how the saying goes, but it's like what is it?

56:33.820 --> 56:36.780
No one ever got fired for using IBM or something like that

56:36.860 --> 56:41.980
No one ever got fired for buying something and it's like one of those really boring but like

56:42.780 --> 56:46.140
Predictable companies. I'm sure people are going to be going to be hitting us

56:46.620 --> 56:49.660
In the in the chat letting us know like what the expression is

56:49.980 --> 56:51.500
But it's like that, right?

56:51.500 --> 56:58.220
And so I think what amd figured out is that even among tech savvy people people who are passionate in care

56:58.460 --> 57:03.580
There's influences on them that might not be passionate might not care or might just you know

57:04.220 --> 57:05.980
Want to cover their butts, right?

57:05.980 --> 57:10.220
So, you know what? I've never I've never gotten reprimanded for buying Intel

57:10.460 --> 57:16.060
So I'm just going to keep buying Intel and all of a sudden whoa epic. Hold on a second. What's this apparently?

57:16.060 --> 57:21.420
Yeah, it was IBM apparently Cisco has used like a similar kind of marketing as well. Yeah, exactly, right?

57:21.900 --> 57:27.340
And so that's one of the things that's really fun and really cool about covering things that we don't normally cover

57:27.580 --> 57:31.580
Do we get every single thing right? Do we hit, you know, all the

57:32.140 --> 57:37.260
Do we manage to communicate all the nuance around the product and its uses?

57:37.980 --> 57:43.820
Do we have a well-built out benchmark suite say for example for, you know enterprise

57:44.540 --> 57:47.020
machine learning the reality of it is no because

57:47.740 --> 57:53.500
So many of these organizations are using completely custom software anyway before they go and buy

57:53.980 --> 57:59.260
10,000 of them they're going to go and they're going to do their own validation. Anyway, you know for us

57:59.340 --> 58:05.820
It's just about hey. This is really cool. We're really excited about it and sharing that passion sharing that energy

58:06.300 --> 58:12.540
And so yeah, I I'm no longer cash and say I'm no longer surprised by the kinds of people that watch us

58:12.780 --> 58:17.260
Just because they want to share that passion and share that energy and and look for inspiration

58:17.740 --> 58:21.900
Um, but I am surprised it surprised me. Yeah, I mean, but it's like

58:22.780 --> 58:27.420
It's very cool. And like you got to understand it to a certain degree

58:28.380 --> 58:30.300
I think it's sort of makes sense

58:30.300 --> 58:33.340
Yeah, I mean if you're if you're um, if you design

58:33.900 --> 58:40.380
Cars, you know, does that mean you just like don't watch top gear? Yeah, because they're doing silly things that don't make any sense

58:40.620 --> 58:41.900
Yeah

58:41.900 --> 58:43.100
No

58:43.100 --> 58:47.740
Yeah, and yeah, you probably know more about automotive engineering than any of those guys

58:48.540 --> 58:52.700
Yeah, but you don't get to do that. Yeah, you're not allowed to do that

58:54.460 --> 58:56.940
You know, what's funny is that's actually

58:57.740 --> 59:03.900
Kind of the story behind how we ended up with that 5,000 watt chiller was uh, buddy from spacex

59:04.380 --> 59:06.860
Um, man, I wish I could shout out his name now

59:06.860 --> 59:11.580
He came up and showed me this like cool little led backlit 3d printed sign thing that he does anyway

59:11.580 --> 59:15.580
I don't know. Maybe you guys I think we shouted him out in the video where he actually showed off the chiller

59:15.740 --> 59:17.740
But buddy from spacex is like, yeah

59:18.140 --> 59:19.980
We ripped this thing out

59:19.980 --> 59:23.420
Thinking that it was broken we put the new one and it turns out it wasn't broken at all

59:23.500 --> 59:25.980
It was actually like a kinked hose somewhere else in the line

59:27.260 --> 59:30.300
And it would cost more to put it back in now. So

59:31.500 --> 59:33.500
I got to take it home and I was like

59:35.340 --> 59:37.820
What am I gonna do with this? You know, it'd be fun

59:38.460 --> 59:44.380
For me is watching you guys do something stupid with it. Yeah, like that's sweet. That's awesome. So since we got it we've

59:45.340 --> 59:48.620
We've put it on like a couple different cpus. We

59:49.580 --> 59:55.980
We bios modded a 4090 to accept up to a thousand a thousand watts

59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.380
Like total board power and then we like chilled that thing with it

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:05.500
We're gonna use it for all kinds all kinds of wild things. Uh, so I guess I I guess I kind of get it

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:06.860
Yeah

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:10.860
But I'm surprised literal rocket scientists are looking to us for inspiration

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:16.620
These guys these guys the the two guys I was talking to with that in particular were the people that design

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.780
the

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.100
The mission control centers. Oh, cool. Okay

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:28.940
So including the like dashboards and stuff that people use and like the the like quick call control panel thing and like the

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.260
All that type of stuff. So it's like

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.660
Yeah, that's flipping awesome. Yeah

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:40.460
data pipelines for receiving video and and like the the chart that shows where the iss is going

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:46.940
And all this other type of stuff. Yeah, seems like an important chart. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, where did it come from?

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:50.220
Where did it go? Where did it come from? ISS? Joe?

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.380
All right, two more topics

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.020
Two more topics. Let's do it. You want to pick one?

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:06.380
Yeah, ea ea blames gamers using high-end hardware for star wars performance issues ea

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:11.180
Man, we used to dog on these guys all the time and then I feel like they were

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:16.300
You know, they learned to keep their mouths shut and let activision blizzard be worse. Yes

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.420
And let ub soft be worse and then they got annoyed

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.460
You know blizzard

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:28.460
Bethesda, they're taking too much of the spotlight. We got to do something really stupid and now they're back

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:33.580
Welcome back. Let's go ea ea has released a patch for star wars jedi survivor

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:43.100
Which has been plagued with performance issues including wildly inconsistent fps massive vram usage broken cutscenes and frequent crashes before the patch

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.020
ea released a

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:50.060
Apology of sorts where it blamed the issue on pc players using windows 10

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.620
on high-end hardware

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:59.180
The official statement i'm gonna skip the first paragraph go right into the second one. No, i'm not i'm gonna read the whole thing from the start

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:06.860
We are aware that star wars jedi survivor isn't performing to our standards for sure for our percentage of pc for a percentage

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:12.140
Great, that's very helpful. So first you hedge your apology. You're not even a full line in yet

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:16.300
Come on a percentage of pc players

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:22.300
In particular those with high-end machines or certain specific configurations

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:28.620
For example players using cutting edge multi-threaded chipsets designed for windows 11

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:32.060
Were encountering problems on windows 10

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:39.660
Or high-end gpu's coupled with lower performing cpu's also saw unexpected frame loss now

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:45.180
Hold on a second. I have to stop you right here. It's my fault if i have a cutting edge high-end

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:47.900
cpu

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:52.300
But it's also my fault if i don't have a good enough cpu. Yes

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:57.660
Carry on you're doing it wrong. Whatever way you're doing it. You're doing it wrong

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.260
They they end it with rest assured. We are working to address these cases quickly

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.700
To be fair to be to be fair

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.420
They're not blaming the people

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:19.500
They're just saying this is where the problems are occurring and we are fixing it, okay

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.500
But does it perform great on low-end hardware?

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:27.980
I think I think it might perform more consistently. I think the problem right now is that you're getting crazy spikes

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:33.660
Right, so the issue then is that they're just they just didn't validate ultra settings. Oh, yeah

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.540
I think so because why would anyone do that?

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:43.100
And and a very good variety of hardware I think is a big part of the problem, you know, it's really sad

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:48.780
Is the probable result here is we're just not going to get high-end sliders

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:54.300
They're probably going to look at this and go, you know what it would have been so much easier for us to just

01:03:54.860 --> 01:04:01.260
Cap it out at whatever the current gen consoles are capable of. Is it just high quality settings that this is a problem for?

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:07.900
That I don't know. I don't think so. I think it's everything, but they're specifically saying the issue is high-end hardware

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.580
Yeah, but they're not saying when put on a high-end setting

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:16.460
It's just high-end hardware at all wouldn't any why would anyone run it on low though?

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:24.780
Yeah, but you can't say like medium is a high-end setting that's fair and medium is a pretty common thing for people to run stuff on

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.500
No, it's all settings. Yeah, people are saying it's all settings. Okay

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:34.220
And apparently there's a there's a new patch which is already helping it

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:38.700
I think people are just mad because the wording of this which it's not worded

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.940
great the

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:46.700
Is it performing to our standards for a percentage of pc players is not a fantastic way to say that

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:49.420
No, that's that's uh, that's fine

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:53.180
That's like when I ask one of my daughters to apologize to the other

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:55.020
Sorry

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:55.980
Yeah

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.540
man

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:07.100
So hardware unboxed disputed ea's conclusion finding that the game ran better not worse on windows 10

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.860
And that both 10 and 11 showed poor cpu usage

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:17.580
Console gamers were quick to point out that they too were encountering game breaking bugs and serious frame rate issues

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.980
This ea blamed on an issue with hdr. That was under investigation

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:27.500
At time of writing the game steam rating is mixed at 56 positive

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.140
Uh, okay

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.940
Runs like my butt after taco bell

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.460
I actually take issue with that

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:41.340
Your butt probably runs pretty well after taco bell. Well, maybe not well, but very fast

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.820
Low latency

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:55.980
Oh boy, um cool. Okay moving on. We need another topic. Let's get out of here. Yeah

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:05.820
Pixel fold pixel fold announced officially after you know, it was leaked by absolutely everyone including video hands-on. Yeah, awesome

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:11.260
Why is it that google can't keep these things under control? I don't get it. I feel like it's intentional at this point

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:18.780
It's literally been every pixel launch since like pixel became a thing. You think so. I think so. Well, I don't know about the uh

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:21.660
intentional thing but

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:24.460
There's no way they care that much

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:29.820
Or else they'd be able to get some amount of wraps on this. You know what? I accidentally pulled my note on wanshow

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.060
like pixel

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:37.340
Two pixel something. Well, and remember like somebody just left some early pixel device at a bar

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:40.700
Well, no, they were mad and I think you're thinking of an iPhone actually for that. Was it?

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.460
Yeah, that was that was pretty that was pretty early on and apple was mad

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:48.060
And I think eventually did recover it and that's all that like was a whole thing

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:53.420
But for the pixel I I did pull one out on wanshow once by accident and they were definitely mad

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:55.500
so

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:59.900
Maybe it shifted since then. Maybe I don't know they just

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.140
Suck at this

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.140
It's hard for me to say

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:08.380
But somehow apple manages to do a much much better job of it

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:16.220
Yeah, like I mean samsung does a better job of it like usually they're basically every other phone maker

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:21.340
Well, I mean it feels like pixel has the most like you were just talking about there's video hands on

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:26.540
Pixel has the most like brutal leaks and that happens with samsung devices as well

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:33.100
But I also don't think it's fair to compare against other mobile device makers either because the reality of it is for the

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.780
vast majority of the rest of them no one cares and that's why nobody

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:41.900
Puts the kind of effort like sticks their neck out to leak this thing because

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.020
Why?

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:49.980
And it's not like you can't find leaks. It's just the the degree to which pixel devices get leaked

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:54.140
I'm sure as Xiaomi me something it's probably leaked at some point

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.580
But it doesn't gain the same kind of momentum. So maybe that's part of it, too

01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:01.740
Is that there's no there's no news cycle around some, you know

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:05.020
Red magic

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:08.220
Gaming phone. Yeah, no one cares. That's fair enough

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:15.100
Well, google has announced the upcoming pixel folds nearly all the details of the phone had already leaked weeks ago

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:18.060
So very little of the announcement was a surprise

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:25.340
According to leaked internal documents, the fold is expected to have a 5.8 inch outer display that folds out into a

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.140
7.6 inch tablet display

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.180
And the most durable hinge on a foldable

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:37.580
There were no particulars attached to this claim of durability such as how many thousands of times the phone can be folded

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:42.540
Before becoming damaged google has not mentioned an exact price or release date

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:47.740
But the fold is expected to cost over 1700 dollars according to the same leaked

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.260
documents

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:50.620
oh

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:54.060
Discussion question how durable does a foldable phone need to be to make it worth it?

01:08:55.180 --> 01:09:00.220
It it can't will the pixel fold be significantly better than the samsung foldable

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.460
so

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:05.580
I would like to talk about that. Yeah, I'm hopeful

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.460
If only because I like

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.380
foldable phones

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:10.940
I

01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:14.220
Well, I don't I shouldn't say I like foldable phones. Would you buy one? I?

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.820
Okay, let's get to that later. Okay. I like

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.460
being able to have a big

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.300
big

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.300
spreadsheet in my pocket

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:31.420
I like this this helps my life. Hopefully that's not important. Uh, no, it's not it's uh, it's the data from how much cooling

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:34.540
Do you need? Okay, uh, so that video went up uh yesterday

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:40.220
This is a lot of data points. Hey, you guys like that. Are you data nerds? Let's go. Yeah

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.940
Um

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:45.180
It makes it just makes a really big difference for me

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:51.820
I want to see the screen tech continue to evolve because right now it seems like you get a year of trouble-free operation out of it

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:55.100
And after that it develops micro cracks at least mine has

01:09:55.580 --> 01:10:01.900
Um, but for me the bigger issue isn't even that because I'll keep using this with micro cracks down this down the middle like

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:07.260
Whatever for me the bigger issue is software and the one

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.180
Most annoying software vendor

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.140
That has made this experience

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:22.380
Noticeably worse for me over the almost three years now. I think I've been daily driving a foldable phone is google

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.900
I still

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:33.580
Still don't have support for stories and in fact this is wild right it's inconsistent

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:39.740
So right now I have only three options. Which ones are missing? I have upload a video. I have go live and I've created a post

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.860
I can't even upload a short right now. I don't think

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.980
Hold on. Do I have another I don't have another phone on me right now

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:51.740
Uh, oh, oh, oh, hold on. Hold on. No might be in the wrong profile might be in the wrong profile for that. So let's do

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:54.620
Ugh

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.660
Okay. Yeah. No. No, I have no shorts

01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.340
Um

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:03.340
That sucks. I'm wearing shorts. I can create a post but hold on a second

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:13.340
Get wrecked or wait, how do I just go to the channel? I'll cry out loud. Just go to the chat. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Okay community

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:19.420
Okay, the community posts at least work now. So that's good. That was broken for a very long time

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.500
But I still

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500
Can't upload stories

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:30.300
Can't upload shorts. I have escalated this and I know they got it because I've escalated it through their

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:38.300
Their creator liaison. I've escalated it through the top creator manager that I have. I've escalated it in

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:42.460
Person at like the vp level. Okay

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.180
to youtube

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:51.980
I have made videos about it. Um, I have complained about it on wandshow

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:56.140
They know they know you know what the problem is

01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:03.740
That this version of the youtube app is the tablet or is is derived from the tablet version of the youtube app

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:09.820
Which was behind on android not on ios where the ipad could do everything just fine

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.220
um

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:16.140
And it was behind the development of all the other apps and we're not talking

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:23.340
Days behind or weeks behind. We are talking years behind at this point

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.060
So

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:28.540
I don't know google

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:33.180
Should I trust this device should I trust you to give two flying

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:35.980
craps

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:41.340
About supporting your hardware properly when you're not supporting your ecosystem partners properly

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:47.180
And you're just putting the tablet version on and then not bothering to update the tablet version of youtube

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:53.500
See this this upcoming generation of phones is probably going to mark an upgrade for me considering all the problems

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.500
I've been having with my phone

01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.420
I can't

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:02.140
The extra street screen space like the the app problems

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:05.100
What I do on my phone. I would probably run into

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.820
Less of the app problems that you run into

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:13.500
And I would probably run into more beneficial things being able to open that spreadsheet would be great

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.900
That type of stuff is going to be more in line with what i'm doing

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.380
Um, but it's a 1700 dollar phone

01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:26.540
That is going to show extreme wear after a year and chat chat. You're not wrong

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:30.460
A lot of them are saying look, they don't care because there's so few of these things out there

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:35.980
I know that's why you should almost never buy the top end crazy motherboard

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:41.580
You should always buy whatever the most popular one is because that's the one that's going to get bios development

01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:44.620
That's the one where they're going to prioritize fixing issues

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:49.100
Because if they don't fix issues, they're going to get 10 000 customer support tickets

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:52.540
And it's going to bury their support department, right if

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.460
You know a hundred enthusiasts have a problem

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:05.740
You know, yeah, those are your theoretically your your best customers who spend the most money with you and you'd think you would treat them well

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.620
But in practice, it's it's not

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:13.820
It's not pragmatic, right to deal with them first you deal with the big problem first

01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:19.740
So they're much more likely not over the short term over the long term. I'm talking five years later when

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:28.220
Resizable bar shows up as a feature. Yeah, the most mainstream board is the one that's most likely to a get a first party update

01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:34.140
And b potentially get a community update that hacks support in because so many people have them

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.180
But that's not an excuse

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.860
If your concern is that so few people need this

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:46.780
This device and need it to work properly then why the f*** you making one? Yeah

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.900
That's the counter argument

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.860
So fine, you don't care

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:57.420
Okay, then don't make it this feels like we're going to run into the same problem a really long time ago

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.820
You and I used to like echoing this whole I don't remember what brand it was. I'm sure you do

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:07.420
But there was a a case in power supply brand that made a case that didn't really fit its own power supply

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.420
Oh, it's probably an tech. I think so. Yeah, I just don't 100 remember

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:17.020
But we used to meme on them all the time because there's like, how do you not try your own power supply in your own case?

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:22.060
And this feels like the same kind of thing like I suspect they're going to launch and they're still going to have these problems

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:28.620
And that's a different level of unacceptable. How did you not run your own software on your own product?

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:32.540
Like if you're going to release a folding phone your stuff should probably freaking work for it

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.420
That's crazy

01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:38.300
I'm still hopeful

01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:40.460
I would like for it to be good

01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:47.260
And there's definitely some things that you know, I wouldn't mind upgrade because this is uh, this is a fold threes

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:49.260
This is this is last gen

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:54.540
Um, there's definitely some things that I wouldn't mind seeing improved. I wouldn't mind a better camera

01:15:55.020 --> 01:16:02.460
So I'm definitely going to try and daily drive it, but I want to see a really good software experience

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:09.740
And if my problem was with I mean, oh, yeah, here's another funny one. If my problem was with third-party apps, right?

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:13.740
Obviously, I get it. You know, how do you incentivize?

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:18.300
a small app developer like float plane ink to

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.140
To, you know, make it so that the app works properly

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.300
within

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.540
You know with my folding phone or whatever, right?

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:31.660
Um, how would they be able to do that if google themselves can't do it?

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:37.900
So I I get that right, but here here's two google apps that don't work properly. I already showed you youtube

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:42.460
Okay, here's the studio. Oh wait. No, hold on. I gotta show you. No, no, this is this is better

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:46.860
Oh, by the way for people interested, uh, the float plane beta sites fixed already

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:52.940
Employees be fast youtube studio. This is the creator app for monitoring your channel and everything

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:58.460
So i'm just gonna casually open. Oh, wait, what what what is that? What are these? What are these pillar boxes?

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.780
Are you kidding me right now? Okay, so then I try and do the same thing

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:05.980
So this comes down to this comes down to app support

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:10.060
So I do the same thing on float plane and I open it up and it just works properly

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:16.780
It fills the whole screen like come on google. This is your own software running on your own operating system

01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:22.780
Okay, technically it's samsung touch with whatever they call it now touch was new touch was

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.860
But i'm pretty sure that you could make this work you've had

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:34.700
Three and a half years of retail availability, which means you've had more like four plus years

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:38.540
Of this product being in development knowing this is happening

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:42.460
And apparently you care about folding devices because you're building your own one

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.020
So you would think you would be trying to figure this out

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:51.820
That's it. That's all my rage for this

01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.620
But i'm still it's all right

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.700
I dodged your question

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.220
Yeah

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:04.700
$1,700 because because it is very expensive, but you have been in the folding ecosystem for a long time now

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:08.780
So exiting would probably be a pretty significant pain point

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:13.820
It's easier for me because I have not been using a folder

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.020
I

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:25.820
Pretty tough. Yeah, not because I can't afford it not because I don't see the value

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:32.220
But I am very cheap. Yeah, and it's not a question of

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:36.860
Yeah, it's not a question of does it have a value to me. It really does

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.660
But does it have

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:43.020
Because like honestly there's a feel right. I don't game on my phone

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:47.660
No, I could get by with like a phone for a few hundred bucks realistically

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:52.220
Yeah, it just needs a good battery life screen brightness. So does it and you can get that for like

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:54.780
399 no problem

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:58.460
But usually like something really nice for 499 599

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:01.180
Usually there's other drawbacks that I find

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.260
Yeah

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:06.140
So is it worth another thousand dollars?

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:10.540
I feel like the way that some people spend money is really different from me though

01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:13.260
Like I will I will drop

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.500
Okay, here's something

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:19.900
I was asked for approval for three thousand dollars for uh

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:26.140
For a like, I don't know three eighths of an inch thick concrete pad in the middle of the lab warehouse

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:33.260
Because they were concerned that if it wasn't level enough the spot where they put our rf isolation chamber

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:37.500
That it could potentially like cause problems. I was like, okay

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:45.100
Because that's that's business right theoretically we're gonna create content and we're gonna generate revenue

01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:48.700
But then if you ask me but there could that's the other thing with the fold

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:52.220
Is if you you said you don't play games on it, but if you work on it

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:57.500
And if you're able to extract a thousand dollars worth of value due to work, I do but my eyes are still okay

01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:04.140
I can I could use a candy bar if I really needed to right like so so if you so if you tell me, okay

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.180
Now it's now it's for something personally

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:11.020
Um, it's gonna cost you 50 bucks

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.500
And it's a it's a bracket that holds up this thing

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:18.620
I'm making myself like yeah, I don't know

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.500
Probably just I could probably just get like a

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:25.820
Like a drywall anchor and a little l bracket and put a piece of two by four on it. It's fine

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.620
right like I

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.620
I just have a completely

01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:34.540
Different way of thinking about stuff that I use personally. Yeah

01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:40.460
Like I didn't upgrade up until we started doing videos about it because I was locked in my house

01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:43.900
Uh for the for the covid shutdown or whatever

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:47.660
I hadn't touched my computer for like several years

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.980
And you would think I would just upgrade my computer all the time because I just you know

01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:57.580
Want a fast computer and obviously there's fast computer hardware like falling out of the sky around here

01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:04.620
You do like working on your house, but that's not necessarily fair because I feel like the example you were giving earlier

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:12.380
Was for something for yourself that was in your house not content a lot of the also that but I feel like working on your house in general

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.100
Benefits like your family

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:16.220
Yes

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:18.460
and content and content and content

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.020
Uh, I like yes

01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:25.420
Sometimes I do it the hard way just because I'm like this will be kind of fun

01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:28.780
Yeah, and that's the thing is I think some people will cynically go

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.060
Well, he's doing it just for content and I'm like no no

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:36.860
I'm doing it because it's fun and fun makes good content. So you missed a step

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:43.340
I could do it. That is actually an important step. I could just hire someone to put a control for a system in my house

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.660
Absolutely

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:49.180
It's not a question of of cost. It's a question of

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:51.900
Well, what fun is that?

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:58.620
Let's make a video about it. Yeah, I can't make a video about some professional contractor coming in and you can't be very interesting

01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:05.340
Well, we've done it. We've done it. I mean brian the electrician. We brought him into just he wired up a stupid ups

01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:08.300
Stupid

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.100
What?

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:14.540
No, no, it adds to it when it's like ridiculous. I don't I'm not wasn't saying it's no it was just it was just a professional choice

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:19.020
It was just a good ups. Yeah, but like and it's like a really sick ups

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.660
Okay, and then we did this. Okay. Okay, but then we did the same thing

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:25.340
I brought in brian the electrician to put a car charger in my garage

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.900
And that was really the boringest

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.420
Siemens

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:36.220
Car charger that ever existed at that point time. I feel like he's a character on the channel though. Uh, okay. Okay. That's kind of fair

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:39.500
That's kind of fair. I'm just saying brian the electric. I'm just saying

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:45.580
We can bring in a contractor to basically do the work and I can make a video about it. I can make that work look

01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:48.780
If I had a superpower

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:50.540
I think it's

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.700
That I can get a million views on a hard drive

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:58.220
And I I've I it's not just that specifically

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:00.780
But it's it's like I don't have

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:07.500
You know mr. Beasts just intuitive sense of how to make the most captivating

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:12.380
Crack cocaine in video form like addictive content

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:14.140
imaginable

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:19.980
I can't do it. I I don't have that kind of imagination and I don't have the kind of

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:25.500
You know slick approach that like an mkbhd or mr

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:32.220
Who's the boss might take to covering the latest smartphone in a way that is super digestible to a mainstream audience

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:36.060
But if there's anything that I can do better than any of them

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:41.660
It's I can get a million views on a hard drive or some enterprise pieces software

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:46.300
Like something that the makers of it couldn't possibly

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:49.180
imagine getting

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:55.580
A hundred views on youtube let alone let alone a million and it was something that I uh

01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:00.940
I remember it just kind of slipped out of my mouth when I was having a meeting with some hard drive manufacturer at like c.e.s

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:03.580
Or something like that, uh, and they were just like, yeah

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:07.980
I mean, I don't know that they basically were not too worried about the video because they were like, I don't know

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.060
They didn't really know who we were

01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:13.180
I don't know. It doesn't really matter. Is anyone going to watch this? I'm like, oh, yeah

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:15.100
like

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:20.540
We are probably the only channel on earth that can get a million views on a hard drive and then I was like, yeah

01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.940
Yeah, we probably are

01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.780
That's pretty cool

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.780
And so that dang it

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:31.020
That's what we can do. That's what I do. That's that's what we do

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:37.900
Heck yeah, uh, all right. What are we talking about? I think we just finished our second of two topics

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:41.500
And we're moving on to the next thing Dan's paying very close attention to the show. You can tell

01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:45.900

The show is brought to you today by hot wheels rift rally hot wheels rift rally is a sick summer gift for gamers and rc car

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:09.820
Enthusiasts and dan is over here and he's oh sick. Oh

An ar gaming experience that is fun for all ages and man

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:26.060
This kind of fpv technology is

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:32.860
Sick, uh, I think the first time I ever experienced it was when we were creating those

01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:39.420
Diy ones for ltx. Oh, yeah, they were a complete disaster because

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:46.220
There were a lot of finicky technical details that we mostly kind of sort of got right. Um

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.100
But the first time

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.100
I I put the goggles on

01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:53.660
And experienced it. I was like

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:59.980
Holy crap. It's very this is like driving around in a giant video game world. It's it's so cool

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:06.300
And they've got a ton of cool gameplay features. So whether you prefer stunt mode challenges single or multiplayer races

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.660

01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.340
Okay, that's really cool

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:37.180
That's something I would not have expected in like a consumer level product

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.940
Um, so different cars handle differently adding to the fun racing strategy

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:45.820
Some of them are great on straightaways, but terrible in turns while others excel in tight corners

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:49.660
Um, and maybe I guess are not as great on the straightaways. Otherwise, you should definitely go with that one

01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:45.660
Uh, we're going to be updating the proposal news during the show. Oh, no pressure. Wow

01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:48.300
Uh

01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:50.780
Thanks to thorham for assisting them in this journey

01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:57.260
Uh, whether you need a wedding ring an anniversary ring or you just want a ring that looks awesome head to thorham.com

01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:02.380
Head to thorham.com and use code when for 20 percent off

01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:08.060
I might not have said anything about that and we could have just quietly updated it assuming it goes well

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:12.860
I really hope it goes well. Um, congratulations. You too. Well, you'll all know if it does

01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:23.100
What I want to give a little additional shout out as well for uh for hot wheels

01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:26.380
There was a somewhat recent I think

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:30.860
A little expansion to force of five, which is a hot wheels expansion

01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:36.700
And it is super fun because they just stopped caring about it being like a realistic racing game

01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:42.780
And you're just going around like hot wheels loops and there's boost packs on the ground and like magnetic floor and all this crazy stuff

01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:50.220
It's very fun. It's like actually very fun. Sorry. I was like I was stressed out and tuned out for a second. Um, sorry, what?

01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:56.860
Uh, so what game how do we how do we know that we have official news by the way? I don't know. I'm sure I'm sure that Dan

01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:02.460
I will be informed. Yeah, and I will let you know or I won't. Yeah, okay that let's let's go with that

01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:06.220
What's what's next? Are we doing merch stuff? No, no, what game are you talking about? So yeah

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:11.340
Forza horizon five. Oh, they have like a hot wheels expansion thing and it's actually like super fun. Okay, cool

01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:15.740
It's very fun. Um, I enjoy it. No offense to the Forza people, but I enjoyed it more than the main game

01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:19.980
Flip plain chat. I can't read your username, but did nerd forage decline going to LTX?

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:24.300
They couldn't make it. They wanted to it's and we don't worry. We haven't had a falling out or anything

01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:30.780
We're chill. Love those guys. It is busy. But yeah life's busy. Yes. We are still going to auction the

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:33.580
amazing PC that uh

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:37.340
I was going to say we co-built but they did most of the really cool work

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:43.020
That that they made for us. Um, that's going to happen at LTX and it's going to be for charity. It's going to be awesome

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.020
Um

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:51.980
Apparently someone watching the show is literally playing the Forza hot wheels expansion right now. Nice. Uh, a nice. It's good

01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:56.860
Okay, it's time for a few merch messages. Dan hit me. Okay

01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:02.300
I went to a christmas soccer match where santa parachuted from the halftime show

01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:05.500
But clipped the roof and plummeted shocking the children

01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:09.820
Uh, what's the biggest mishap in front of a crowd you've witnessed?

01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:12.780
Wow

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:15.340
No part of that sounded real. Uh

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:25.420
Wow, I mean, yeah, I'm never gonna beat that story. Yeah, like what?

01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.900
So

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:30.140
I don't know. I don't feel like I've went. Oh

01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:33.500
I know mine

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:37.180
I don't mind a hundred percent. No question. Okay. Go

01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:40.140
Jensen just going off on stage

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:43.020
at um tom peterson. Yeah

01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.740
that was

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.820
incredibly awkward

01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:50.140
and and like

01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:56.940
The videos are bad. I wasn't there. I was there, but I've heard that in person it was it was rough

01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:00.780
Because like the camera didn't show the whole thing, but you could see

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:03.980
Tap like when he went off stage and stuff

01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:10.540
And like he handled it very professionally in my opinion. Jensen super did not but tap did

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500
but like

01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:18.860
It was just it was actually more awkward because their response to it was not matched

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:24.700
Right, like if they both handled it super poorly, it would probably have been less awkward a fight. Yeah

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:28.300
But instead it was just someone in a position of

01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:31.020
Very uneven power

01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:37.500
Just like clap it on someone on stage and it's just like man. I that was that was rough. That was very rough

01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:42.060
Biggest mishap in front of a crowd

01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:47.900
I'm just trying to think like honestly the ones that the ones that I do definitely hit me the hardest

01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:53.900
But I haven't spent that much time in front of a crowd like I've definitely made some mistakes

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:59.660
I dropped that razor blade laptop when I was supposed to be unveiling it at the first LTX that was not the best

01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:05.980
Kind of sick. Um very on brand. I but yeah, at least yeah, it wasn't it wasn't that bad. Like I've never accidentally

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.540
You know

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:11.420
I'm just trying to think of anything that would be really really bad

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:15.500
I mean, I've done lots of dumb stuff on street. Does that count?

01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:22.060
I don't know. I mean like okay, like I've thrown stuff into a crowd and like

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:28.860
Accidentally nailed people with stuff and it's been pretty bad. Like that's bad. I guess. Mm-hmm. That's a mishap

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:34.220
I'm not gonna stop doing it packs used to be a lot more fun when they allowed that they have hard banned it now

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:39.100
You're not allowed throwing anything not even t-shirts. Really? Yeah, it's not stupid. No, I'm gonna throw stuff at LTX. Yeah, heck

01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:41.180
Yeah, let's go. Yeah, let's go

01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:48.220
Next line is liability tips. Mr. Linus. I occasionally hear South Park references

01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:53.980
Do you have a favorite character or episode? How would you feel about your likeness being portrayed on the show?

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.940
Oh favorite favorite episodes got tenor in must die

01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:03.660
100% that's when that's when Cartman went from just kind of like an awful little child to the

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:06.620
Complete sociopath that we know and love now

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:11.900
Um, you know, if I had to pick a few handfuls, I mean for me really the golden ages from about

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.820
late season two slash season three to maybe

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:23.180
I guess as soon as we start making it into anything with the coon anything with the kind of continuity from episode to episode

01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:25.660
With stupid integrity farms and all that kind of garbage

01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:27.180
um

01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:31.420
Pretty much that so kind of like season three season eight season nine maybe ten

01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:39.740
Kind of kind of in there. Um, so, you know, Cartman land is amazing anything anything where Cartman is particularly evil and then gets particularly

01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:41.820
F***ed on is pretty much my favorite

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:47.820
All right, let's see next one here. Love the show boys

01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:53.020
Linus as a fellow late 80s child and currently in IT tech

01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:57.260
How do you adjust seeing younger and younger people join your team?

01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:00.540
Uh tech especially seems like a young person's game

01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:03.820
Yeah, I mean for me it's um

01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:07.500
What choice do I have?

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:10.860
Right like if we if we want to if we want to stay

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:12.620
hip

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:14.060
and with it

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.340
you know

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:16.780
and uh

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:18.780
and uh

01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:21.420
I don't think either of those are currently trendy names and down

01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:23.900
You know we want to stay

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:29.180
Bussin. Yeah, I don't know if that's good or no cap for real for real. Yeah, exactly

01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:33.580
Uh fire we I can't I can't expect myself to be cool

01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:39.900
I never was so the best that we can do is we can keep trying to attract talent keep trying to evolve

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:43.100
Keep bringing in fresh ideas and that's where fresh ideas come from

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:48.220
Fresh ideas don't come from people who have been doing this for 30 years, right?

01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:50.860
so

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:53.980
Yeah, I uh, I I guess I I don't know

01:37:54.540 --> 01:38:00.620
It's a funny thing because at work. I don't really think about that. I'm like, you know twice jake's age or whatever

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.940
It doesn't really matter. What?

01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:06.060
No, it's not twice, but but i'm a lot older than him

01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:11.020
Um, and I and it's it's the same like it's it's not until the slang comes out

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:17.580
That I noticed someone's actually part of a completely different generation for me because tech is our common language

01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:19.580
right

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.660
So when you've got that in common, it's easy

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:27.980
But if I was to go to a completely different environment if I was to go to a club or something

01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:36.940
Yeah, I'd I'd feel far more out of place because of because of the the differences in my maybe music preferences or

01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:38.700
um

01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:46.300
Yeah, sure my my my way my manner of speaking, you know does anyone still speak valley girl? Like is this this is still acceptable? You know like

01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:49.420
like like like like

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:51.900
Like I don't know

01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:54.220
um

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.180
It's fine. Yeah, that's right. It's good

01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:01.500
It's it's just part of the process and in response to that second part of the south park question

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:07.660
If that's a real, you know offer if you actually work on the show, I I can't I can't believe that's even a question, of course

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.940
next

01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:15.180
Well, I think that was three. Yeah, why don't we why don't we slide another one in here? How about that?

01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:17.900
slide into my dms

01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:23.660
Yeah, do people still say that I don't know probably I mean it's all it's all that's all it is anymore

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:26.060
Someone does no cap for real

01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:29.020
she

01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:31.020
That was bad

01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:39.660
Hello dan and the support staff line us a game of would you rather would you rather allow dan to remaster the christmas album?

01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:45.100
Or allow luke another shot at pizza warmer pc. Thanks for all you do

01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:51.020
Dan you got to stop sending your own merge messages

01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:54.300
That's not how this works. I archive most of them

01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:57.820
Stop talking about the christmas album

01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:00.220
The christmas album is not happening

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:04.940
luke gets another shot at pizza warmer pc before you remaster the christmas album

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:09.180
There's no question in my mind, especially because luke never had a first shot at the

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:12.860
piece that the pizza warming pc because it wasn't supposed to be

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:21.820
A pizza warming pc. It was supposed to be a pizza heat retention pc. He just completely misunderstood the concept

01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:28.060
Thank you for the excellent merge message

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.620
Okay, what do we do next I don't know give us the card

01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:41.420
We don't we can't do anything. We don't give us okay some more topics, please. All right. Oh jeez

01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:47.100
Oh, I don't want to hate you all. Why do you all troll me like this?

01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:52.140
You try to upset me make me do something say something. I'm not supposed to say on stream

01:40:52.460 --> 01:41:00.380
Google engineer warns public researchers are winning the ai race a leaked document from from a senior google engineer luke samau

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:03.580
Hopefully I said that right warns that now. I think quite close sir

01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:07.260
S-e-r-n-a-u. Yes, that's an annoying typeface

01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:12.940
Warns that both google and open ai may soon lose the ai race to open source development

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:21.260
grassroots engineers have been making huge strides in part due to the leak of meta's lama llm in part in

01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:23.900
massive section

01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:27.020
Probably a factor

01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:33.340
According to the document neither company has had the kind of secret sauce that will be enough to keep them ahead

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:36.460
I believe they described it as a moat neither company has a moat

01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:43.100
Worse while they've been focused on each other open source development has been quietly lapping them both

01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:48.060
With many public researchers achieving more with a few hundred dollars and a few weeks

01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:52.060
Then what large companies are struggling to do with millions over the course of months

01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:54.620
because

01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:57.660
Those open groups are playing catch up to be clear

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:05.020
They're not lapping them is not a really fair way of saying it because they're they're still catching up

01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:08.460
But it's fine. It sounds cool. We're gonna stick with it

01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:12.220
Specifically cited was the issue with running ai models on phones

01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:18.620
Open source models are faster more customizable more private and pound for pound more capable

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:26.460
Luke the previously quoted person therefore urged that google should work with and learn from developers outside the company

01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:32.460
Meanwhile an open letter to the european parliament authored primarily by german research group

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.220
lion

01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:42.220
Has advocated against regulation of grassroots development and smaller ai research firms in part to keep the e u competitive with the united states

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:47.420
Quoted rules that require a researcher or developer to monitor or control downstream

01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:52.140
Uh downstream use could make it impossible to release open source ai in europe

01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:57.660
Which would entrench large firms and hamper efforts to improve transparency

01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:05.100
Reduce competition limit academic freedom and drive investment in ai overseas like many ai forms

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:11.500
lion has been criticized for not respecting the rights of artists whose work is included in their open source database

01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:17.340
Including threatening countersuits against artists who've requested their work be removed

01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:22.620
Cool

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:28.860
Yeah, we've been talking about this on wancho for a while, but it's interesting seeing someone in within google talk about the same thing

01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:34.460
Well, you got to make a bold prediction now

01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:41.180
You got to keep the streak alive. You don't get to just be no nostradamus didn't get to just make you know three predictions

01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:43.740
Absolutely nail them and then go

01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:49.180
Well, i'm retiring with a perfect record. You have to keep making predictions. You want to know something funny

01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:52.620
You know how you've talked about this a bunch and i think this is genuinely very true

01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:56.780
One of the reasons why line of sectives has been punchy for so long is because you get bored very quickly

01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:58.780
Yeah, i'm bored

01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:03.100
You're bored already i'm bored, but but new stuff is happening the problem

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:04.300
Yeah

01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:12.780
Isn't a lot of this stuff isn't actually really releasing especially not really in the way that people talk about its capabilities

01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.540
Like a lot of the stuff that open ai is doing

01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:19.580
It's alphas and they're only giving it to some people

01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:23.580
So like the plugins thing we talked about this weeks ago

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:25.740
Do you have it?

01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:27.740
No, i don't have it

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:30.700
Right, so if i don't get to play with it, why do i care?

01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:35.580
That's fair the uh co-pilot for office

01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:40.540
Yeah, looks like an insane disrupter. Yeah, where is that? Where is it?

01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:42.620
So

01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:49.340
I'm kind of gmail. I'm kind of in a gmail. Where's googles? Well, hold on. Here's what i really want to know

01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.100
Call evan ho

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:02.540
Oh, wow it managed to do it i'm impressed

01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:05.260
but yeah, like

01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:07.660
I'm not i don't know if i should necessarily say bored

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:12.700
I'm feeling like it's unnecessary to keep up with the news right now because

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:14.540
we're

01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:20.220
I feel like just like open ai had like the fastest adoption of a million users of anything like ever

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.300
Right, I feel like there's you know that curve

01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:24.300
I don't remember the exact name of all the stages

01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:28.060
But you have the massive hype at the beginning of a new technology

01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:31.420
And then you have the massive drop of people realizing that it's like

01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:37.180
Kind of junk right now because it's so new and then it jumps back up when you get to very productive stages

01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:41.100
And people actually start releasing things and it becomes very usable and then it trend lines

01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:43.820
forever basically

01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:50.460
And I don't feel like we're actually at the bottom of that first drop yet, but I feel like we're over the hump

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:54.380
Because we're at the point where everybody's heard about it

01:45:55.260 --> 01:46:01.980
Everybody has seen at least one really really cool demo of it like hub curve. Is that what you're looking for? Is it? I don't know

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.020
It might be okay

01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:09.660
But yeah, everybody's heard of it like my even people that like

01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:14.300
Are not into tech stuff has heard of it because it's been in mainstream news all that type of stuff

01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:20.780
You've given everybody the fear. You've given everybody the hype. You've given everybody all that kind of stuff now. It's time to

01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:24.780
This is not

01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:26.780
Exactly what I was describing

01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:29.020
It's the shape of the curve though

01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:31.260
very much excite very

01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:33.340
thing happen then

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:40.140
Less thing happened then as it gets better thing happened. Yeah, that's pretty close. Yeah, I think it's I think it's explaining the same concept

01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:42.140
It's just not the exact curve that I was talking about

01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:46.140
But yeah, it's time to

01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:49.020
Deliver it's time to ship

01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:51.340
We need stuff apparently q3

01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:57.900
For uh for our co-pilot cool, so I'm excited for q3 right that's where I'm currently looking

01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:00.620
Yeah, I guess that kind of is similar to how we

01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:05.180
Really stopped talking about rumors so much on land show way back in the day

01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:11.660
Like we used to talk a lot about oh, here's the rumored spec of the upcoming g-force whatever

01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:15.980
And then it's got annoying what we'd realize is that the following week

01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:22.780
There'd be a new rumored spec ever so slightly different or sometimes the same but more sure this time

01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:27.020
And then the following week it would be and then we just kind of felt like broken records

01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:29.980
We're just talking about this over and over and over and over again

01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:37.820
And making noise that has absolutely no value outside of the very moment that we first talked about it

01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:43.100
Why don't we just wait and then it's out and then we can create an evergreen piece of content

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.260
That will always inform you about that product

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:48.940
I think that's that's a mistake that I see a lot of starting out

01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:53.820
and even fairly experienced content creators making where they they

01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:59.260
Make a video or write an article or whatever else it is whatever their medium is

01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:04.780
And they they make something that is relevant today

01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:13.500
And I think what they're missing is the algorithmic importance of someone watching your video or listening to your song

01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:15.260
or

01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:21.660
Reading your article from a year ago or two years ago and still getting a value out of it. Ah, okay

01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:27.500
Okay, what's this called? It says this is the Gartner hype cycle the hype cycle

01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:30.780
So the bottom left hand corner thing is technology trigger

01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:36.300
So the thing kind of shows up peak of inflated expectations trough of disillusionment all this type of stuff

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:38.460
So I feel like we're we're kind of

01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:41.340
Just over the the hump right now

01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:44.140
and if you're saying

01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:46.460
If you're saying that it's going to be q3

01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:51.740
We'll see we'll see yeah, and hopefully we can avoid it too big of a ton

01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:55.260
But yeah, exactly what you're just describing. I'm feeling that way about it

01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:58.300
I don't think there's actually a lot to talk about even this literal topic

01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:01.420
We have literally already talked about it, right

01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:03.420
so

01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.700
yeah

01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:05.820
content

01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:11.420
Back to what I was saying make content that is evergreen and you will be amazed what that will do for you

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:17.820
You never know when like every once in a while one of the views that I like to look at in our analytics dashboard

01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:20.140
Is what people have been watching?

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.220
most in the last 60 minutes

01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:26.220
And what's really interesting about that view that real-time view

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:31.180
Is that a lot of the time it's obviously going to have your last couple of videos you released

01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:37.660
But once in a while you'll have stuff show up. Okay, so one of the things that's most watched in the last 60 minutes

01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.420
is

01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:41.420
adam's amd ultimate tech upgrade

01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:49.340
Okay, that really helps me keep an eye on what kinds of videos are gonna are gonna pop off in the longer term

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:54.860
And get a get a second wind and a third wind and a fourth wind and really really take off

01:49:55.660 --> 01:50:00.940
And you will never put yourself in a position to do that if you create content that is just

01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:05.980
About the rumor mill just has absolutely no relevance, and I'm not saying there's no place for that

01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:11.100
We created a whole channel for it. It's called tech linked. We created a second channel for it. It's called game linked

01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:16.220
Which don't worry we will we will launch we will launch eventually

01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:22.620
There's been some challenges internally getting it getting it across the finish line, but we're we're gonna get it there

01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:27.820
It's gonna be awesome. It's gonna be great. Riley and his team are doing an amazing job getting everything set up for it

01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:30.540
but

01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:34.060
Okay, ai I guess we'll just kind of play the waiting game and yeah

01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:40.140
Like maybe we talked about something here. They're like someone in chat said look at the auto gpt repo graph

01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:42.220
It's literally the graph you just showed

01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:44.300
And it's like yeah, like right

01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:51.740
Yeah, it's it's there. There is cool stuff happening chat or the chat gpt code interpreter thing looks super sweet

01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:56.780
But like almost none of us can even try it. So whatever. I don't know. I'm off the

01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:59.660
I'm I'm still paying attention

01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:02.780
But until we get more

01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:04.940
Things shipped products shipped

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:08.140
I think I'm I think I'm kind of chilling for now. All right

01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:14.140
Why don't we talk about oh and and sorry one other thing because people keep spamming this

01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:17.340
I know a lot of the new ai stuff is open source stuff

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:22.620
Totally and that's fantastic. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm not saying they're moving slowly

01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:24.700
I think they are moving super super fast

01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:26.940
I am also thinking that they aren't

01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:30.940
Quite a hundred percent there and one of the reasons why they're moving really fast

01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:36.060
Is is like the the leaks and whatnot that we've been seeing that the transparency on what

01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:39.580
Data sets that these companies are using to feed their models

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.580
um

01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:45.900
And a lot of other kind of stuff like that people breaking off from these big companies to start

01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:52.380
Startups that are currently working in the open source base. So they just sort of happen to know what's going on over there

01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:57.500
Stuff like that is happening a lot right now, which is fantastic. It's very cool. Um

01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:01.420
But it's the same thing

01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:05.820
Um, so it's it's not like the most exciting talk. What a way you know what else is happening a lot right now

01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:11.180
What's that amd's new u-class of chips. Oh, okay. I know

01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:12.780
that

01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:18.780
On wan show it's not necessarily the best place to get your news about an upcoming cpu or

01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:25.260
Or gpu because we can't you know, put up all the graphs and and all that kind of stuff that is that is really helpful for

01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:27.740
Understanding just how good this product is

01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:35.580
But you don't need that what you need is hype hype hype hype hype hype hype hype because these things are amazing

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:42.060
amd has released specs and performance data for its new zen 4 rise in 70 40 u

01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:46.620
phoenix series processors. They're designed for thin and light laptops. So these are like

01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:49.900
15 to 30 watt cpus like

01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:53.020
The framework laptop 13

01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:57.980
I'm so excited

01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:02.300
Not just as an investor. I just want one in my laptop

01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:04.780
They're based on zen 4

01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:09.100
Okay, so latest cpu architecture with rdna 3

01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:17.500
Based radeon 700 m gpus and team red says these chips should be able to go head to head with apple's m2 processors

01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:21.820
With the flagship 78 40 u supposedly performing 75

01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:24.780
Better than the m2 in past mark 10

01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:29.100
you notice apple's whole apple silicon thing like started out like

01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:31.420
really strong

01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:35.260
And in typical apple mac fashion has kind of got

01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:39.100
Oh, good enough just deflated. Let's leave it where it is

01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:44.460
Like remember when they launched the mac pro and they were like, yeah, we're back with upgrade ability

01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:50.860
And it's going to be different this time and they launched the mac pro and then never updated it again

01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:54.540
Why do they

01:53:54.540 --> 01:54:00.940
Just why are they so apathetic toward their mac users? I don't know. It's kind of shocking. Yeah

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:03.660
Anywho

01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:11.420
amd also claims victory over intel's competing 13th gen chip the core i7 13 60p by 30 to

01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:15.020
228 percent on various tests

01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:20.140
If you look closely and this is really cool. Uh, this chart is from

01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:26.620
Uh, a non-tech credit a non-tech for this chart. This is amazing if you look closely

01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:29.580
Uh, hold on

01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:32.460
Okay, I can't uh dan. Can you move uh us?

01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.020
Please. Yeah, thank you one sec

01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:41.980
The ryzen 7 7 8 40 u bears a lot of resemblance to the ryzen z1

01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:45.900
Extreme they both have eight core 16 threads

01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:51.980
Really, that's how you do. You know, it doesn't matter. Uh, 12 cus in their igpu

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:55.740
uh 16 megs of level 3 cache

01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:57.500
and

01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:59.580
A maximum 30 watt tdp

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:10.220
How interesting. Oh, I did that just in time. Yeah, it's fine. Uh, the ryzen z1 extreme is going to be powering the rog ally when it launches next week

01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:20.300
These chips are amd's first to launch with ryzen ai which is powered by its xd and ai architecture courtesy of the company's acquisition of xilinx last year

01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:27.100
Ryzen ai will apparently power upcoming features in windows 11 like the studio effects pack that can be only used with

01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:32.540
AI hardware. It's possible people will be able to hack around it, but it will almost certainly

01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:36.940
Result in additional power consumption, which on a mobile device would not be desirable

01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:40.380
So just because you can work around it doesn't necessarily mean that you should

01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:47.740
Speaking of windows being optimized for certain chips. This is great windows 12 might end up optimized for custom

01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:56.060
Microsoft silicon arm based socs if multiple new job listings for chip designers are any indication

01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:59.420
Would you buy microsoft silicon?

01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:05.420
Well, don't look too enthusiastic

01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:12.300
I find with a lot of microsoft hardware products

01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:15.420
There's a bunch of really cool stuff

01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:17.820
and then there's some like

01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:19.820
Glaring drawback problems

01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:22.460
Yeah, and then there's not necessarily like

01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:32.460
It's not like apple's perfect. You know, I think the fact that they rugpulled 3d touch, which was the coolest feature ever

01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:35.660
Sucks, you know, yeah

01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:39.100
But in general

01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:44.460
If you upgrade from an iphone to an iphone from a mac to a mac you can expect some degree of continuity

01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:47.260
And that was definitely intentional

01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.740
whereas

01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:54.300
On the windows side and even within microsoft's own surface products

01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:56.940
I don't feel like that same thing exists

01:56:57.020 --> 01:57:02.700
They don't have the same level of commit and whether that's an unwillingness to continue to invest in things that

01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:07.500
Or not immediate w's or whether that's just maybe not

01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:16.300
Thinking ahead enough as to like what about the viability of a product like microsoft has some like serious wins in the hardware space

01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:22.140
But you know sofs in the name they've always felt like a software company like uh

01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:29.900
Do they do they still can can you still do they still have that aio that you can like stick the surface dial to the screen or whatever?

01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:33.020
Oh, yeah

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:39.980
The surface dial is apparently still a thing with 363 reviews on the microsoft store

01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:48.220
On surface. I can't even remember what some of their pcs were called surface surface studio or

01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:52.700
Studio people are saying studio. Is that the one? Okay. Can you still buy a surface studio?

01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:59.340
I remember even when it launched it had last gen hardware in it. Yeah, have they updated this bloody thing. Okay. Let's have a look at it

01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:07.900
Am I am I just ignorant? Nope. It's still like $9,000. I want just the screen. This is a laptop

01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:10.060
Okay, now hold on just a gosh darn minute computers

01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:14.060
Uh, so who wants to all of my surface studio two plus

01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:21.900
Okay, did I just did I just miss something here? Is this is this current? Yep starting from 6,000 canadian dollars

01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.540
Where's my text back set?

01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:28.380
Uh, okay, that's still a 28 inch display, which is like fine

01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:34.540
11th gen processor. No, this has not been updated

01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:43.420
So this is just can I can I order this thing 11th gen processor 32 gigs of ram and a 1 terabyte ssd

01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:48.620
For six grand non-user serviceable. I've repaired one. They're brutal. This is just

01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:51.740
languishing

01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:57.180
And it was you know, some parts of it were were cutting edge. So thunderbolt 4 is still it's got windows 11

01:58:57.580 --> 01:58:59.340
relevant

01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:03.260
Is this real I can actually order this outdated computer

01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:08.620
Wow, I'm sure glad I customized this I can choose

01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:11.420
English keyboard or terrible keyboard

01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:19.580
Is that it select a configuration? I mean, well, yeah, what other one am I going to select Microsoft?

01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:22.460
My options are that and that

01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:27.260
And then I can decide if I want any Microsoft 365 with that

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:30.940
Uh, no, I don't want additional protection

01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:36.140
This is it I can get a wireless headset

01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:39.820
Um, an ugly mouse or a different ugly mouse

01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:43.260
Wow

01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:47.260
Yeah, so that's the thing like where's your where's your commit and it's not like okay

01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:53.020
We just criticized apple for releasing a literal $40,000 computer that they then

01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:57.980
Pretend start immediately start pretending doesn't exist anymore. Yeah, right

01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:03.420
But this is regular for Microsoft. It's like it's like it's like Netflix, right?

02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:09.820
So you you kind of sit there and go. Oh, yeah, I love this paradigm where I have this like zero gravity hinder whatever

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:12.780
And I can put my dial on my thing and I can do all this stuff

02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:17.820
Will this continue to get any development? Like what's going on with the surface duo?

02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:21.820
AJ's all

02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:26.220
I guess AJ uses the french canadian keyboard layout. I'm sorry to hear that

02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:29.900
You employ this man

02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:38.300
AJ's great. He can he can have an exception. He can have his he can have his bad his bad

02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:41.420
Okay, what what's going on with this thing?

02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:48.220
Microsoft has just started casually low-key not providing regular updates for it

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:55.980
Um, I saw an article that was and I don't know how true the the speculation about the reassignment of the team is but

02:00:57.180 --> 02:01:00.220
Someone's saying it's updated each year. Apparently not the processor

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:04.860
Oh, yeah, no that it's not fair to just say like, yeah, we ship with a more up-to-date

02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:10.060
Operating system. Yeah, that's not an else is updated. Yeah 11th gen 11th gen

02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:13.660
It at rtx 30 60

02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:15.740
like

02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:16.860
I don't know

02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:20.220
Was it was it? Well, hold on a second. Did the original one happen?

02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:24.140
I think it has been updated because I did the video on the first one

02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:28.700
Okay, so like it's been a minute dude. It's been

02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:32.380
Probably like seven years

02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:37.660
It must have received at least one update, but it is not currently up to date. I would say

02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:43.660
Okay, well, maybe maybe I'm just being mean, but yeah surface duo is another one that I'm just kind of looking at going

02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:46.940
Yeah, really?

02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:50.620
I mean if you search for surface studio, this is another thing too like

02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:53.980
I guess even if they are updating this thing

02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:57.020
Does anyone care?

02:01:57.020 --> 02:02:00.140
So we've got this one result and then it's just laptop

02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:05.020
Oh, wait. No. No. No. We've got no one PC. Okay. Is anyone buying this thing?

02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:07.820
Again like I said, oh wow

02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:10.860
No reviews yet be the first

02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:13.580
Whoa

02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:15.580
That's a yikes

02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:17.900
That's a big yikes

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:22.780
Okay, cool

02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:27.260
I think we have some news. Oh we do

02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:29.260
Oh

02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.660
Yeah, just give me a second here guys. No

02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:34.060
No time given

02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:36.060
Geez

02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:38.300
Now everybody's expecting something breaking news

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:41.660
I think we have breaking news

02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:46.700
Okay. Oh, oh, it's all going wrong. My phone's going off now. Oh geez

02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:51.660
We have news. Oh

02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:54.060
Oh, we have news. Oh. Oh, it's good news

02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:57.500
Oh, yeah, what did you think we was trying to leave some suspense?

02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:04.620
Would you like to see the news? Okay. Yes hit it hit it. Okay. He said yes

02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:07.340
I believe he said yes

02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:10.620
Yeah, it was it was our pleasure. Thank you very much

02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:18.620
Um, it's a lot of fun. We've had kind of we've had some requests for from people to uh, you know

02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:23.980
Do stuff before I receive a shocking number of wedding invitations

02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:26.380
No, really though

02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:31.580
They don't even give them to me anymore because I'm just like, yeah, this is super weird. I really just don't think I'm gonna

02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:33.980
I I actually

02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:36.220
I have to confess

02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:41.900
I almost went once when I found out about the wedding invitation thing because apparently they just would never give them to me

02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:47.740
I was like, oh, that's hilarious. We should do a channel super fun where we all show you wedding crash

02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:51.340
Just the whole gang the entire company

02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:54.300
We have a response from them too

02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:56.700
um

02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:00.460
Sorry, we have a response from who? Um from our new couple

02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:07.500
Um, he said yes tell Linus and luke. I am so so happy and really appreciate of their help

02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:09.740
appreciative of their help awesome

02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:11.580
um

02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:16.460
But anyway, I would actually be very funny. I was talked out of it because it would also be

02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:23.340
Uh, very disruptive. I mean there's family there and the venue would have no idea that this is happening and like

02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:28.860
Like I would just not the idea was that I would just not rsvp and then we would just

02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:31.660
show

02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:33.500
It would

02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:35.820
Be really funny though. It'd be really funny

02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:42.220
Anyway, the point is don't invite me to your wedding because we're not doing that. I was talked down. Yeah

02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:44.860
Yeah

02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:46.460
Uh

02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:49.660
Judge protects anonymity of eight redditors

02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:53.340
So the background here is a group of film studios

02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:59.980
We're trying to prove that internet service provider astound was turning a blind eye to piracy committed by its customers

02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:06.460
They demanded that reddit unmask the identity of certain users who commented on posts about piracy

02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:12.780
Including they wanted the ip address registration and logs from january first 2016 to present

02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:16.300
They wanted the name email address and other account registration information

02:05:16.940 --> 02:05:22.140
reddit provided some information on at least one user but refused to unmask the rest

02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:24.620
leading the studios to file a subpoena

02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:27.900
reddit responded that this was a phishing expedition

02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:32.060
Uh four of the users never mentioned astound two mentioned astound

02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:36.460
But weren't talking about copyright infringement and one user's comment was from 2014

02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:39.020
outside the time frame of the lawsuit

02:05:39.980 --> 02:05:44.380
And american law anonymous communication has traditionally been protected as part of the right to free speech

02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:48.540
Because it shields people expressing unpopular opinions from potential retribution

02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:54.780
The judge ruled that the studios had not demonstrated a compelling need to overrule the user's free speech rights

02:05:55.180 --> 02:06:00.380
So there you have it. Um, you can still talk about piracy on reddit including naming your isp

02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:03.020
I don't know how long that'll last but

02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:08.940
Every once in a while something goes right speaking of which

02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:11.900
Biofire is getting ready to release

02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:17.900
America's first commercial smart gun. Oh, what uh, they're a startup

02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:25.500
They're launching a smart gun with facial recognition and fingerprint unlock that will fire only for registered users

02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:28.860
Okay, well, this is bs. Oh, don't worry. We're getting to that. Okay

02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:33.340
The gun will be available as soon as the fourth quarter of this year making it potentially the first

02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:39.260
Commercially available smart gun in the u.s. There are however smart guns available abroad. Just can you relax?

02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:45.420
This is wrong broad that require the user to wear a linked smart watch or similar device

02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:49.580
So the shtick here is that it's using fingerprint and facial recognition

02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:54.140
60 percent of gun owners apparently say they would be interested in a smart gun

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:58.380
And the potential for the technology has been around for a long time in 2000

02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:04.780
Both colt and smith and wesson agreed to create government sponsored smart guns, but they were boycotted by gun owners

02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:06.540
and

02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:08.540
Evidently that never happened

02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:17.260
Now there is some concern around these products that they may not fire when needed and during a demonstration earlier this week

02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:19.900
club fur

02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:21.980
Okay, I guess that's name

02:07:22.300 --> 02:07:27.580
Fired the gun then another demonstrator picked it up pulled the trigger and nothing happened

02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:32.860
When club fur took the gun again, it failed to fire twice then fired correctly

02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:35.980
A second prototype worked as expected

02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:45.180
You have 20 seconds to comply. Okay, luke now you can talk about the smart gun. It's just it's not true

02:07:45.260 --> 02:07:50.140
It's not the first what do you mean? These have existed for years in america. I don't care

02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:53.100
You think america's not gonna have a gun like

02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:59.260
Gun exists in world a gun in america. These have to be true at the same time

02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:01.740
like

02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:07.900
I don't care. It's just not true. There's like there's videos of people defeating these from years ago

02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:10.940
The first one. I remember somebody just took a magnet

02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:18.220
They they held the the the pistol and they just took a magnet and they went bonk and then it fired no matter what

02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:24.460
It just immediately was just steel. Yeah, it just immediately defeated it. These have not only existed

02:08:24.620 --> 02:08:27.820
But they have been terrible for years like

02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:35.020
We are the first to release and I can't believe the amount of coverage they got on this

02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:38.300
I googled fire arm requires fingerprint to fire and it's

02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:42.380
Everywhere all from just this one how biofire

02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:47.020
Got this coverage is wild when no they are not first to market

02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:50.300
I can't believe people would lie on the internet

02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:53.580
It's wild

02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:57.420
I think the facial recognition thing like sure, but where do you define?

02:08:58.060 --> 02:08:59.260
smart

02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:05.100
Like what yours is smart because it's fingerprint and facial recognition the previous ones weren't smart because they were just fingerprint

02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:08.220
What if someone requires like something else?

02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:10.860
What if someone requires like a 2fa code?

02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:15.340
I say it's smart when it has like chat gpt integration

02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:19.340
And chat you have to talk it out of shooting you chat gpt

02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:23.580
Has evolved to the point where it doesn't tell you to kill yourself

02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:31.100
So I want like a really, you know

02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:33.980
top functioning

02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:36.780
You know large language model that you know will kind of

02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:41.900
Advise me on the proper use of it. You know, maybe maybe that's smart. That's not a smart gun

02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:45.180
Bullets on the blockchain

02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:54.220
Anyway, that was the whole reason that I wanted this topic in here so that I could talk about chat gpt on a gun

02:09:57.340 --> 02:10:03.100
And I think it's time for us to move on to when show after hours, which is basically more of that

02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:05.660
Oh

02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:11.580
Help we have a new banner for that. I'm gonna click this button and let's see if it does anything

02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:16.060
Hey, now I get to get up. Hey, there we go. Cool

02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:23.660
Wow, did that even change the the corner at the corner. Oh my god. It says after dark under. Okay. Um, I'm sure glad

02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:25.100
I rip one

02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:27.420
No, actually, why does it smell like fart?

02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:29.820
um

02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:36.300
Did you did you crap yourself? No, because that's a possibility. I mean you technically didn't ask me if I crapped myself

02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:41.660
So that's not ruled out yet. Oh my goodness

02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:45.740
That was wild. Okay. Anyways, um

02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:50.940
March messages, I'm gonna start trying to I've already been trying to respond to some of them through text

02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:52.940
I'm gonna jump in and try to do more now

02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:55.740
We will fall into our formation

02:10:56.460 --> 02:11:01.500
Yeah, if you guys want to deal with some potentials, I'll start yelling at you with the curated. Okay. Here we go

02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:09.500
Dear Linus being very busy CEO of LMG and trying to eat healthy slash feed a family sounds very hard

02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:12.540
Have you ever thought of hiring a private chef?

02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:15.340
sincerely someone who makes food for money

02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:16.780
um

02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:21.820
The only reason that I haven't is that I don't want my kids to grow up with a chef

02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:26.060
Yeah, I feel I don't necessarily know that we've talked about that, but I knew that answer

02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:31.340
Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, and I respect that I well the thing is like, okay

02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:33.900
that I'm gonna play devil's advocate

02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:36.380
against myself right now because

02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:38.140
um

02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:45.260
What if by having a private chef my kids were exposed to far more variety in their diet

02:11:45.820 --> 02:11:47.820
and healthier food

02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:51.660
You know Yvonne and I would never be an interesting way to do it

02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:56.540
Maybe is if you had your kids cook with the private chef if it was like a cooking tutor

02:11:57.260 --> 02:12:00.220
Okay, cooking tutor sure. Um, but I mean

02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:07.100
Okay, sure, maybe uh, look, I don't know. I'll get to that in a second

02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:10.460
But like realistically, you know Yvonne and I are like any other

02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:13.580
both parents work family and sometimes

02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:19.420
Um, like one thing we're really good about is we always send our kids to school with lunch

02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:21.820
Uh, so they never go to the cafeteria

02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:27.340
Even though that is technically an option. Um, so they always bring a bring bring food from home

02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:31.020
Um, but occasionally that food ain't great

02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:34.700
You know, we'll be up at midnight and we're kind of going. Oh, holy crap

02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:39.260
We don't have anything for lunches tomorrow and we'll like just whip up some annies, you know

02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:46.300
Mac and cheese or whatever and throw it in a throw it in a thermos. All right kids enjoy. I mean, they love it obviously

02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:50.380
But it's not good for them. It's not healthy, right? It's got so much sodium in it

02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:51.180
I have no idea

02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:55.580
But I would assume annies is better than like a craft and dinner thing. Well, sometimes they get craft dinner too, right?

02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:57.820
Fair enough, you know, right

02:12:57.980 --> 02:12:59.340
and so

02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:03.900
from a from a from a what's what's healthier for your children

02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:12.540
Is it to is it to eat the healthiest food that builds the best brain function and and body function and growth?

02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:21.180
Or is it to, you know, live on the in the real world where people don't actually have a chef that makes them food every day, right?

02:13:22.380 --> 02:13:24.780
Um, would would they end up more helpless?

02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:30.460
I mean, I think your idea of having having them help with food prep is great in theory

02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:33.500
But I can tell you we have lots of great ideas in theory

02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:37.820
Like I have the idea in theory of creating some kind of bonus system

02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:41.420
Where if you're the first one dressed in downstairs and eating your breakfast

02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:44.540
Then you get some kind of star that gets you some kind of reward

02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:50.700
Because positive reinforcement works so much better than negative reinforcement, but in practice it's early and I'm tired and I'm just gonna say

02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:55.500
Get downstairs. We gotta go like you just yell at them, right? Like so it's

02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:00.140
Yes

02:14:00.220 --> 02:14:06.060
But realistically if the kids are not helpful that day or busy with they're still gonna make the food or whatever

02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:10.300
And kids are smart. They're gonna figure that out. Oh, I'm conveniently busy. Yeah

02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:14.220
Oh, I have to go to the bathroom one of my middle child is like the queen of that

02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:16.780
Okay, guys need to empty the dishwasher

02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:21.340
Okay, you have to go to the bathroom and then the dishwasher is three quarters empty by the time she comes back

02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:26.940
She puts away two things and she's like I helped and I'm like, yeah, uh, you're looking at the king of that trick

02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:32.300
Go do something else. I used to be really bad for that and my family thought it was intentional

02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:34.300
But I just have really intense gamer bladder

02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:38.300
And I would stand up for the first time after a very long time

02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:42.300
And then actually just need to go to the washroom and I used to get in arguments where I'd be like

02:14:42.620 --> 02:14:47.660
Just leave a bunch of it for me. Like I'm not I'm not trying to avoid it. I'm not saying that's what's happening here

02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:49.900
But definitely not. Yeah, that used to happen to me

02:14:51.500 --> 02:14:53.500
All right next up. Okay

02:14:53.900 --> 02:15:01.500
Do you have any comment on all the eight gigabits of vram not being enough conversations? It's gigabytes, but um

02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:05.420
I mean, yeah, yeah, this happens all the time

02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:09.980
game developers keep, you know pushing the envelope and

02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:12.700
Graphics card manufacturers. I mean, okay

02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:16.300
So you gotta you gotta look at what is a gpu, right?

02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:20.380
You've got the sand in the middle the gpu itself

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:29.340
And that the intellectual property is mostly owned by your amd. You're invidia or your intel. So the the the

02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:30.780
manufacturer

02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:35.820
Some of the ip may be co-developed with a samsung or a tsmc or whatever else for that particular chip

02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:37.900
but but largely the ip is owned by

02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:46.780
That designer of that silicon and so while there's a lot of cost associated with it to the board manufacturer

02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:51.900
Or to you the consumer the actual cost on that is largely in the development

02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:53.500
of it

02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:59.100
Right now there is obviously what they pay for silicon wafers from a tsmc or a samsung

02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:02.780
But a lot of that cost is intellectual property

02:16:04.540 --> 02:16:07.500
So there's great margin in it is what i'm trying to say

02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:10.540
Ram on the other hand

02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:18.460
Is not the intellectual property of invidia or amd. They help contribute to standards like graphics ddr

02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:20.700
Or hbm i think to a degree

02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:22.940
But they don't own that

02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:27.580
And so when they buy ram they buy it from samsung or micron or whoever else

02:16:27.820 --> 02:16:32.300
There's a lot less margin in buying commodity memory and strapping it to a board

02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:39.100
There's also basically no margin in integration of things like heat sinks and pcbs like vrms, right?

02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:45.260
So then with all that in mind if i am trying to reduce my

02:16:45.980 --> 02:16:50.940
My total bill of materials does it make sense to build a crappier gpu?

02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:55.740
Or do i want to put a really good gpu on it that has lots of cool ai tech that helps me sell my product?

02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:01.500
Or do i want to downgrade the memory that has a much bigger cost and is much less marketable?

02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:06.060
Well i don't want to put on any more frame buffer than i absolutely have to that memory

02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:08.460
So that's where they're going to try and

02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:14.380
They're going to try and lower their bomb cost or the bill of materials cost for the graphics card for the completed card

02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:21.740
Invidia does spend money in weird ways sometimes like when they first started putting these super high-end coolers on their cards

02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:25.820
I guess this is back in the 700 series these like cast aluminum

02:17:26.940 --> 02:17:31.100
Heat sink shrouds and like these really fancy, you know machined back plates and stuff

02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:37.260
Uh, I it kind of never made sense to me because i'm sitting here going like oh well that's that's unnecessary

02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:39.900
That doesn't contribute to performance. That's very non-traditional

02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:44.380
And then you know they go and do weird things like the three and a half gig ram thing with the 900 series

02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:46.220
um

02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:48.220
So is it necessarily the best?

02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:53.660
Uh, is it the best plan for them to cost up a heat sink and cost down on memory?

02:17:53.740 --> 02:17:56.220
I don't know. I i'm not an engineer

02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:04.220
But I can tell the community is not happy about it and yeah more vram is absolutely a great way to future-proof your

02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:11.180
Purchase but I will say this too. It feels like it's making a bigger difference right now than I'm used to it making in the past

02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:17.980
We've seen two and four gig versions four and eight gig versions of the same cards many times in the past many times in the past

02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:24.300
And the general rule often has been that by the time that vram is a limitation for you

02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:30.140
Realistically the performance of that gpu is going to be a bigger limitation

02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:36.620
But we're seeing people modifying these graphics cards putting extra memory on them and getting much better performance

02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:39.900
and that's over the last couple of generations now so

02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:44.300
Yeah, I can I can see some justification for amd's

02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:49.740
Snark that they've been throwing at in video about how they've been kind of cheeping out on video frame buffer

02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:52.620
I just got a message from our community

02:18:53.580 --> 02:19:00.620
Uh coordinate. Oh, could you mention this on behalf of the ltt folding team? It's on the wansh

02:19:01.980 --> 02:19:04.300
I missed it because it was buried with the merch stuff. Yeah

02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:08.380
ltt is competing in the boink pentathlon

02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:16.540
Uh, it's a two-week competition where teams lend their unused processing power to perform calculations for five different projects in science

02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:17.980
physics and mathematics

02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:22.780
ltt has competed only twice before with our best rank being sixth overall in 2021

02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:27.180
The event has been running for around 24 hours at this point. We're currently in sixth place

02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:29.820
There are over a thousand dollars of prizes up for grabs

02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:36.940
Um, and if you're up to the challenge, you can come on and join the team prizes include 10 100 ltt store gift cards

02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:41.660
And a handful of steam gift cards prizes are a raffle from all active participants

02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:47.260
So no matter how powerful your computer is you have the same chance to win the link will be posted in chat

02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:50.380
And I will do that now

02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:56.780
Pretty awesome. This is one of the things this is the kind of thing that we want our community coordinator doing because it's like

02:19:56.780 --> 02:20:01.420
It's not like we don't want to throw prizing it the community and support these kinds of things

02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:04.220
It's just that I don't personally have time to oversee it

02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:10.940
So I I need someone to actually follow up and you know send out prizing and that sort of thing. This is great

02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:13.500
Fantastic. Thank you very much for the reminder

02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:15.500
I

02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:20.060
Was going to say name, but I think this individual is not off probation. Cool

02:20:20.940 --> 02:20:22.780
hit me again

02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:28.460
Sure thing. Hey l l and d love the show a question luke might be able to answer

02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:34.060
I bought some bird seed recently. How long does it take for the birds to grow once I plant them?

02:20:34.380 --> 02:20:36.380
The cashier couldn't answer me

02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:39.100
I

02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:43.420
What how long that's not it's not you feed it to the birds

02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:46.060
Huh

02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:52.780
I'm a security professional at a game company finding it infuriating the uber siso stated

02:20:53.420 --> 02:20:56.700
Skated his cybercrime charges. It's a lot of seeds. I want to start again

02:20:57.020 --> 02:21:04.060
That's a lot of seeds in this one. I'm a security professional at a game company finding it infuriating the uber siso

02:21:04.220 --> 02:21:11.020
Skated on his cybercrime charges. There you go. Are you worried about being held liable for one of your employees?

02:21:14.860 --> 02:21:16.860
Uh

02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:22.540
Did I miss something here? I was replying to text one. I I think we for one of your employees

02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:27.020
I don't know if we technically know the full story there. Is uber getting pinned with this. Is that what's going on?

02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:29.020
I don't know

02:21:29.020 --> 02:21:30.940
um

02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:33.500
Are you worried about being held liable for one of your employees? I mean, yeah

02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:36.860
absolutely

02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:40.620
Like it is it is it is totally possible for someone here

02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:42.140
to

02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:46.940
Say something or do something that could maybe not legally

02:21:47.900 --> 02:21:50.460
Um cause problems for me, but absolutely

02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:57.260
Perceptually cause problems like I think if if someone here came out as some kind of hyper toxic

02:21:57.900 --> 02:21:59.740
um, you know

02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:06.220
Like let's let's let's pick something sort of unequivocally bad like a nazi supporter or something like that

02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:14.460
Um, I think that if we didn't take any kind of action that could that could reflect really poorly on our company and on me personally

02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:16.060
so

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:20.220
Yeah, definitely. It's something that we're concerned about and it's something that we try to

02:22:20.860 --> 02:22:24.060
Try to be cognizant of as we're as we're continuing to build our team

02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:27.260
As we want to make sure that to the greatest degree we can

02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:32.460
Everyone who works here is like kind of awesome, you know, that's I think a pretty

02:22:33.980 --> 02:22:36.300
Shouldn't be that hard, but it's but it's difficult

02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:42.380
But I think it's a good and worthwhile goal and something that I actually talked to our hr department about like earlier this week

02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:44.700
It's like what do we care about we care about?

02:22:45.340 --> 02:22:50.620
You know working with people that you know want to be here and want to and and are are excited about

02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:54.060
You know what they're doing and what our mission is right, which is to

02:22:54.780 --> 02:22:59.660
Make consumer electronics and technology more exciting and more accessible to people

02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:03.660
If you don't care about that and you don't want that then you should go work somewhere else

02:23:03.660 --> 02:23:08.540
Where they do something that you do want to do and that you are excited about like that's fine

02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:11.500
Right, you don't have to work here

02:23:11.980 --> 02:23:13.340
Yeah

02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:20.300
Okay up next. Hi l ld thoughts on licensure for software or electronics engineers like the more

02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:27.660
Additional engineering disciplines ethics rules could require that engineers don't enact anti consumer practices, for example

02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:32.140
Okay, so this is a whole thing where

02:23:33.180 --> 02:23:40.460
Engineer can be a protected term where you can't call yourself an engineer unless you have gone through a particular program

02:23:40.940 --> 02:23:43.740
And or you are a member of a particular

02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:46.940
Organization that

02:23:46.940 --> 02:23:48.940
Has its own sort of internal

02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:52.300
Governing rules for your behavior

02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:54.300
um

02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:56.620
I think it would be super cool

02:23:57.420 --> 02:24:01.580
if you know the engineering body had rules like

02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:05.340
Yeah, members who want to call themselves engineer

02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:08.700
Cannot enact anti consumer practices

02:24:09.980 --> 02:24:17.900
But they would basically just create a situation where every licensed engineer or certified engineer or whatever you want to call it

02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:22.220
Would be utterly unemployable because many companies

02:24:24.220 --> 02:24:28.060
And it's a it's a weird thing, but many companies seem to put themselves on

02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:31.900
Opposite sides of a struggle with their customers

02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:38.060
For how they can extract more money from them, right? And so I think that it would be it's noble

02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:45.260
But I don't think it's realistic. I was having a similar conversation about this with someone very recently actually

02:24:46.060 --> 02:24:52.540
Where it was basically along the lines of yeah, it would be great if everyone kind of came together and said, you know

02:24:52.620 --> 02:24:54.620
What let's not do that anymore?

02:24:54.940 --> 02:24:56.940
um

02:24:57.020 --> 02:24:59.020
Oh man, what was it?

02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:01.900
It was microsoft

02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:04.380
If microsoft could put pressure on

02:25:08.620 --> 02:25:11.820
Uh was something it was like some kind of like awful like software

02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:18.300
Software behavior or something like that and I was like, yeah, that would be great. But it just yeah, it was the same answer, right?

02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:21.340
It's just it's just not realistic. They'll find another way around

02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:24.460
exploiters gonna exploit

02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:28.620
Keep the new despad designs coming

02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:33.180
Question are there any products on lttstore.com that you would

02:25:33.900 --> 02:25:39.340
Consider a flop or underperformer or any products that were better than expected

02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:42.060
The towels

02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:44.220
Are better than expected

02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:46.700
Everybody needs towels sold like a hundred towels today

02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:48.860
like what

02:25:48.860 --> 02:25:55.900
Why towels? I mean, yeah, they've got a cool keyboard design and they're good towels. I'm not like I'm not down on the towels or anything

02:25:56.300 --> 02:25:59.660
I just thinking about getting some towels to be honest mine. It might are a little old around

02:25:59.660 --> 02:26:05.420
Yeah, I need new towels as well. Yeah, everybody needs towels like maybe it's just one of those things where sometimes accidentally

02:26:05.900 --> 02:26:10.940
We just kind of go man shopping for towels sucks. Yeah, what if there was just a place to get

02:26:11.420 --> 02:26:16.380
You know towels at this, you know, just know they're gonna be good and it's fine price any size you want

02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:18.300
um

02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:23.740
I don't know. I don't get it because we we we had got them back in stock last week. I think and they've just been

02:26:24.460 --> 02:26:26.460
crushing it since then

02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:28.140
Um as for flops

02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:30.380
Oh man, I could tell you about some flops

02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:34.460
Our first attempt at women's clothing was a pretty big flop

02:26:34.540 --> 02:26:38.860
I mean the reviews are pretty good for the the original sweatpants and cropped hoodie

02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:41.420
But the sales have not

02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:43.980
not been

02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:46.460
Very strong

02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:48.460
I can tell you guys that much

02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:53.580
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that's kind of middling. I think that we're gonna have to come up with some

02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:56.380
Actually, you know what? Why don't why don't we talk about it?

02:26:57.260 --> 02:26:59.260
the one time that we've kind of

02:26:59.820 --> 02:27:05.020
Taken it to price on products from ltt store was um black friday

02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:10.540
And I think what we'll probably do is continue to have that be like

02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:15.020
You know the time that we'll run, you know price promos or whatever else

02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:20.140
But there may be one other time and I think we're gonna kind of piggyback on prime day

02:27:20.780 --> 02:27:22.780
And we're gonna do lime day

02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:28.620
They might not be sweet deals, but they're sour and tangy in a delightful way

02:27:29.420 --> 02:27:31.420
That's like kind of

02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:33.500
Kind of what i'm thinking for it

02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:40.220
Lime day, so maybe like nothing actually gets discounted, but there's like it'll be good though bundles

02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:46.860
No, no, no, no, no. No, I'm talking just like well, we'll take stuff that's like, yeah, this isn't really working and just blasted away

02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:50.700
Yeah, I I expect isn't that how like are they all work?

02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:55.580
That's what we did on black friday. Yeah, but isn't that what like everybody does?

02:27:56.540 --> 02:28:00.860
Um, I mean well no because amazon just hikes the price up in the months leading up to it

02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:05.660
So i'm saying we won't do like lie about it. No. Yeah, cool. Oh, no, no, no

02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:08.060
No, we're gonna if we discount something

02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:11.500
It's because this is the normal price and we are blowing it away

02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:15.260
Yeah, so you're gonna have to move pretty fast if you want to get your hands on any of that stuff

02:28:15.340 --> 02:28:17.340
I I don't know

02:28:17.340 --> 02:28:23.980
Which items we're gonna do. I think I have a meeting with nick next week to figure out what kind of things we're gonna run for lime day

02:28:24.940 --> 02:28:26.220
Um

02:28:26.220 --> 02:28:31.980
But I do have some candidates in mind some stuff. I okay, I'd say our sweatband set hasn't been a smash hit

02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:36.460
We've never restocked it. We're still sitting on like thousands of units from our initial order

02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:38.860
But they're sweatbands. They don't take up a ton of space

02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:44.860
They have reasonable margins. So they don't cost a ton to store. We make money on them and

02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:48.940
They're well reviewed. So it's not like we're it's not like they're a problem. They're just

02:28:50.220 --> 02:28:52.780
You know selling a little bit slowly. So that's fine

02:28:54.860 --> 02:28:56.860
There

02:28:57.420 --> 02:28:59.340
Okay, illd

02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:04.540
Tech like ar and interactive content has transformed my industry broadcast media

02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:12.620
Are there any technologies that have fundamentally transformed how ltt operates? Um, and is there any horizon besides ai?

02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:19.340
I'd say the biggest one that's impacting us right now and will continue to impact us is

02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:22.140
Well, okay, you say besides ai, but too bad

02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:27.900
Is the ability to reach new audiences through ai-generated?

02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:30.940
transcription translation

02:29:31.660 --> 02:29:33.660
and voice generation

02:29:33.660 --> 02:29:35.660
Because at our

02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:37.660
Scale it's just

02:29:37.660 --> 02:29:44.060
Yeah, obviously I'd love to hire dedicated translation teams and professional voice actors for every possible

02:29:44.780 --> 02:29:47.100
Dialect of every possible language, but it's not

02:29:47.580 --> 02:29:51.260
Feasible if we're we are not mr. Beast

02:29:52.060 --> 02:29:53.580
right if there's

02:29:53.580 --> 02:29:58.780
A hundred million speakers of one language and we're getting a hundred thousand views of okay. Let's let's take mr

02:29:58.780 --> 02:29:59.340
Beast, okay, right?

02:29:59.340 --> 02:30:06.940
So you've got however many like a billion plus english speakers if he takes his video and he translates it for a billion, you know

02:30:07.580 --> 02:30:13.740
Hindi speakers he can double his views which would be 30 or 40 million views of video

02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:16.460
That cost is is is negligible

02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:22.060
Whereas if we take our english viewership and we translate it to let's say

02:30:23.020 --> 02:30:25.020
portuguese, okay, so we get

02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:33.100
Millions but not hundreds of millions and certainly not a billion right compared to our english-speaking audience or or english accessible audience

02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:39.980
All of a sudden, okay, if we can get a million or two million views, maybe we get like 200,000

02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:43.900
Those economics don't make any sense

02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:48.780
So and even even for something like hindi they don't necessarily make sense because

02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:55.500
The cpms for views in those languages and views in those regions are so much lower that it's not like you're just doubling your reach

02:30:56.300 --> 02:31:03.660
So for us we need tools that make it more cost effective for us to support more languages and I'd say that's going to

02:31:04.700 --> 02:31:07.180
Probably not double our business, but could help us

02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:14.460
Grow 10 or 20 percent just by by reaching a broader audience over the next couple of years as we work that into our workflow

02:31:17.500 --> 02:31:20.620
Apparently there are only approximately 350 million hindi speakers

02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:27.740
So I guess a lot of Punjabi as well. I don't know the actual like dialects. It's a lot of people. Yeah, it's still a lot

02:31:28.860 --> 02:31:30.860
Hey, luke. I just

02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:32.860
read

02:31:33.340 --> 02:31:35.020
How you doing?

02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:39.820
I just read the news that scientists taught pet parrots to video call each other

02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:45.980
What do you think about using tech not to make ownership easier but making the lives of pets easier?

02:31:46.220 --> 02:31:49.660
I think it's super cool. Yeah. Yeah, I I don't know if I talked to you about this

02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:53.980
I should have sent you the article, but I probably forgot it's actually really wild

02:31:54.380 --> 02:31:57.340
They they taught parrots to video call each other

02:31:57.900 --> 02:32:00.860
And they found that over time they made friends

02:32:01.580 --> 02:32:04.700
And those friends would more frequently call each other

02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:09.660
So it wasn't necessarily even just that the one would like learn to press the one button more easily

02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:12.460
Because the other one would also be like, oh, this one's my friend

02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:14.380
So it would call that one back as well

02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:19.260
And they would like go get their toys and like show their friend on the video call the toy

02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:22.540
And they seem to understand that their friend is only in this thing

02:32:23.100 --> 02:32:29.180
But they can like call them when they want and like they introduce them in person after and see if they still recognized each other

02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:31.820
I don't think so

02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:33.980
But like actually

02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:35.420
Super cool

02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:36.780
That's wild

02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:42.620
And like there was clearly they like enjoyed it and they're having fun and they're being social and all this kind of stuff very very interesting. Yeah

02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:45.820
But yeah, I don't know

02:32:45.820 --> 02:32:51.660
I mostly just wanted to explain the story of what they were basing that merch message off of because that's super interesting

02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:56.860
And yeah, if you can use tech to enhance the lives of your pets, why not? That sounds great. That's super cool

02:32:56.940 --> 02:32:58.940
So, yeah

02:33:01.180 --> 02:33:03.260
Next up I feel like I already read this one

02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:09.020
Yeah, and okay. Hey LLD. Love watching the wan show, but how

02:33:09.900 --> 02:33:15.260
Do you always keep the discussion interesting? Is there a threshold for the cutting room floor?

02:33:17.500 --> 02:33:20.220
Oh boy, I don't know that's a good question

02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:23.260
We can we can be pretty vicious about topics

02:33:23.980 --> 02:33:25.020
Yeah

02:33:25.020 --> 02:33:27.260
I mean you look at the way that I will sort of

02:33:27.820 --> 02:33:32.060
Okay, I think AI is a perfect example of this where lukes

02:33:32.860 --> 02:33:35.500
Patience for it was a little bit longer than mine

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:42.300
And it starts with oh no lukes gonna talk about AI again, you know as a as a

02:33:44.460 --> 02:33:49.580
A cue as a as a prompt that hey, this is probably kind of getting there

02:33:49.660 --> 02:33:53.020
You might want to keep this one short like that's the that's the unspoken

02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:58.220
undertone of the joke that I'm making and then if he doesn't

02:33:59.260 --> 02:34:04.780
Get the clue and I'll be like all right. Let's move on and he does the same thing to me

02:34:05.900 --> 02:34:10.220
So I think that between the two of us how quickly we get bored with things

02:34:10.780 --> 02:34:13.260
Helps us to keep the conversation moving

02:34:13.820 --> 02:34:15.820
Um

02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:19.100
And realistically like you guys I think

02:34:20.940 --> 02:34:23.260
I think the cynical among you won't believe me

02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:27.180
So you can just plug your ears and go la la la and pretend this isn't happening

02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:29.100
But for the rest of you

02:34:29.100 --> 02:34:34.460
This is not actually that dissimilar to what it's like when we just are on discord

02:34:37.180 --> 02:34:41.820
He in particular swears a lot less on wancho than he does on discord

02:34:42.620 --> 02:34:47.420
I think neither of us is as politically correct on discord

02:34:48.460 --> 02:34:51.740
Because we don't have to be and we're tired or whatever

02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:59.420
It takes we're we're getting older it takes energy because I honestly just forget like there's certain terms that aren't

02:35:01.020 --> 02:35:05.900
It's moving really fast and it's actually kind of hard to keep up with i'm trying but yeah

02:35:06.140 --> 02:35:07.420
Yeah, um

02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:11.020
There was there was one time not even that long ago. We went out to dinner after wan

02:35:11.420 --> 02:35:15.420
It ended up just continuing to talk about tech stuff the whole time. Yeah, so like

02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:20.220
Why didn't we even stop the show? We just needed food. How do we keep it?

02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:25.900
You know interesting. Well, I don't know as long as I'm interested in what he's saying and I feel like hanging around with him

02:35:26.300 --> 02:35:28.300
And vice versa the wancho will be

02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:31.020
It's gonna be fine

02:35:32.700 --> 02:35:34.700
That's pretty much it

02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:42.060
Okay, uh, this one's from sarah need more women's underwear colors

02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:48.060
Guys if you were to support a new ltt channel that isn't completely tech or gaming

02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:51.900
What topic do you think would be the easiest to get off the ground? Oh?

02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:54.860
Easy

02:35:54.860 --> 02:35:57.740
Yeah, easiest is tough. No, because I would oh

02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:04.300
Okay, I'm sure I'm I'm ready automotive. Oh, okay. That's tech though

02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:09.660
Okay, I yeah, honestly, that's fair and we'll we'll we'll do more later

02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:17.500
There's no way that like between jake and alex and gary who are all like giant petrol heads and they're just yeah

02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:23.980
Yeah, never mind andy mick. There's a bunch the more you like think about it. There's more and more and more. Yeah

02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:25.820
No

02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:31.420
You see these guys at like the go-kart track. There's no way we don't eventually end up with some kind of dedicated car channel

02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:33.420
It's just a matter of time. Yeah

02:36:33.660 --> 02:36:37.180
Okay. Yeah, that one. I mean, I was gonna say like I wouldn't pick something easy

02:36:37.260 --> 02:36:39.820
I pick something that I actually think is fun like I

02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:42.860
Well, the question was easiest to get off the ground. Yeah, okay

02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:45.580
But you can take it that way

02:36:45.580 --> 02:36:49.180
Auto sure fine. Yeah, I accept it. No, I accept it. I take it fun. Take it fun

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:53.820
I'd want to do something with my kids. I'd want to do like, uh, I've you know what?

02:36:53.900 --> 02:36:58.380
I've always wanted to do a like thrifting channel. Yeah, just like

02:36:58.940 --> 02:37:03.340
Go to thrift stores and like I can turn this thing into something else or yeah

02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:10.620
Even just I found something cool or whatever. Yeah, just find weird stuff because it's basically unboxings except you're not limited to whatever the

02:37:11.340 --> 02:37:17.180
Shiny piece du jour is you could go look at anything from anywhere and just kind of poke at it

02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:22.300
So you find an Atari at a garage sale. So that's the video you let you go out you're looking for something

02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:23.660
and

02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:24.540
You've

02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:30.140
Find it and maybe it's broken you solder some caps you play it and your kids are like this is a crap game like, okay

02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:32.380
Fair enough

02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:36.300
But it was cool adventure. Yeah. Yeah, but at least you tried something, right? Yeah

02:37:38.540 --> 02:37:40.140
Hello LL and D

02:37:40.140 --> 02:37:44.060
Is there an ETA on when there will be big and tall sizes available?

02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:51.580
And will there be an option for big and tall for those of us who are bigger than Linus in all three dimensions first big

02:37:52.300 --> 02:37:56.780
And tall then big and tall if all of that goes well

02:37:59.900 --> 02:38:01.420
No ETA

02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:03.500
No, well big is coming

02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:05.820
And then we'll be tall

02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:08.780
And then assuming all goes well big and tall

02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:14.540
I don't want to give a timeline. We're we're trying. It's more important that we get it right than that. We get it soon. Yes

02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:17.260
Big agree. Let's see if I can get this right

02:38:17.820 --> 02:38:24.780
Dynas duke and lan can you please explain why windows file explorers still can't show folders size on disk?

02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:28.780
And instead of having to go into the properties. I don't know

02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:35.260
It drives me crazy because I think it used to yeah back in windows xp. Didn't it used to and like realistically

02:38:35.500 --> 02:38:38.380
You know the amount of crap that windows does in the background

02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:45.100
Why isn't just probing that and making sure that it's constantly available in an index

02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:48.940
Just a thing it does then it by all means allow me to turn it off

02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:53.980
But it should be a feature. I used to manually run my index all the time so it would populate faster

02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:57.660
And like I use a third party tool that does it in five seconds

02:38:58.300 --> 02:39:05.820
And including my entire nas. Yeah, like come on bro. It's it's available. It's a thing. Yeah, it's mind boggling and the fact that it takes

02:39:06.540 --> 02:39:09.900
So look this is f***ing metadata

02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:15.980
You don't have to dig into the contents of you're not watching every movie on this drive

02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:18.860
It's metadata

02:39:19.580 --> 02:39:20.780
To me

02:39:20.780 --> 02:39:22.780
The fact that stuff like space sniffer

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:26.220
Isn't a first party tool at this point is just like

02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:31.420
Yeah, it's kind of mind blowing. What? Yeah, like winder stat. I think is a more um

02:39:32.300 --> 02:39:36.700
Recently updated when I think space sniffer stop came we've moved on to whiz tree now

02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:39.820
Oh whiz tree, which is like three seconds to do

02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:43.980
500 terabytes. It's amazing wild. Wow

02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:48.860
Um, okay moving. Oh, yeah, what what are some features that you would expect to have by now?

02:39:48.860 --> 02:39:52.460
Or is that like the major one for you? Oh, I'm I'm sure there's stuff

02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:55.580
But I can't think of anything off the top of my head. Okay lld

02:39:55.820 --> 02:39:59.420
How can I read my boss's mind when he doesn't have time to tell me?

02:39:59.660 --> 02:40:05.100
How can I accurately evaluate context clues to deliver a report that is what he's looking for?

02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:10.380
There is no there is a question. Is this what are you even talking about what you mean?

02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:16.700
What this is this is such a good question. Yes, it's a great question. You don't understand because you're that person

02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:19.420
Yeah, everyone hates you for this

02:40:19.900 --> 02:40:21.180
What?

02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:23.580
What are you talking about? What do you mean?

02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:28.460
How about I'm that person have you never had this experience with somebody?

02:40:29.980 --> 02:40:33.100
Oh, I guess you're the boss. So it's like yeah, you're the person

02:40:33.180 --> 02:40:36.940
Okay, well this question is about you're the boss that this person has to deal with

02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:39.900
Let's uh, let's use it Vaughn as the context here

02:40:40.460 --> 02:40:43.100
Uh, if you could pretend Vaughn is the boss

02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:48.860
That's not pretending, but I don't deliver reports to her because she knows they won't be right. So

02:40:49.980 --> 02:40:53.660
Um, like yeah, I don't I would I would I would never how can I

02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:57.420
Accurately evaluate context clues to deliver a report

02:40:58.140 --> 02:41:03.820
Is what they're looking for so Linus will do to be just I have to be fair here Linus will do both

02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:05.900
Linus will give you

02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:11.100
Tons of information and a perfect. This is exactly what I want all every question you could have answered here

02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:13.340
Go do it and he'll also do

02:41:13.980 --> 02:41:17.980
I want this thing on and they just walk away and you have to figure it out

02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:20.780
he'll do both um

02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:23.180
And I don't know it just kind of comes over time

02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:28.460
Well, my expectation is that I have a world-class team full of smart people who are

02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:32.780
Hardworking and that they will probably figure it out and if they don't figure it out

02:41:33.500 --> 02:41:39.260
Then I will tell them what they didn't figure out and then they'll probably figure it out better next time like I

02:41:39.580 --> 02:41:41.580
It's yeah like that's

02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:43.580
Am I am I the idiot here for?

02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:48.540
Not seeing the problem with this. I don't I don't think it's a huge problem

02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:54.140
I think to a certain degree for efficiency sake you can't have like insanely detailed things every single time

02:41:54.620 --> 02:41:58.780
Um, but sometimes it's really important like we laid out. We okay earlier this week

02:41:58.780 --> 02:42:06.860
We had to have like an hour-long meeting about the plan for uh, how we're going to represent. Yeah, uh, how we're going to organize the

02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:11.900
data that we present on the lab's website for for a category like gpus

02:42:12.060 --> 02:42:17.260
There's like an actually absurd amount of information and there's a lot of valid ways to do it

02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:18.540
So we have to kind of decide okay

02:42:18.540 --> 02:42:22.620
Well, what do we think is the best way and in order to decide that we have to have a clear

02:42:22.940 --> 02:42:28.380
Idea of what the vision is for the site past minimum viable product past v1 past v2

02:42:28.780 --> 02:42:31.100
And into you know, what a v3 might look like

02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:36.460
So that's something that I have to be involved in because I can't possibly expect anybody to know that

02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:38.380
Yeah, but if it's

02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:41.740
Hey, here's a product. We need to make a video about this

02:42:43.580 --> 02:42:45.740
I expect them to go

02:42:45.740 --> 02:42:51.820
Look at some of the the documents that we have like we have a we have a document called how to write good videos

02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:56.300
And

02:42:56.780 --> 02:42:59.340
Most of it is stuff that I would consider to be kind of

02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:05.260
Common sense to a degree, but it's also even something that's common sense

02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:12.780
It's still helpful to have written out as as a reminder, right? So here's how to how to write good videos

02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:17.820
One the 10 laws of Linus one don't waste the viewer's time

02:43:18.060 --> 02:43:23.660
What's the point make your point as concisely as possible while maximizing clarity? Tell me why I should care

02:43:24.140 --> 02:43:28.220
Number two control the scope make sure your point isn't too broad

02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:31.500
Think of the game portal its shortness is its greatness

02:43:31.900 --> 02:43:36.860
Recognize when something has gone on for too long this involves reading it to yourself at full volume

02:43:36.860 --> 02:43:39.340
No whispering and seeing if you run out of breath or patience

02:43:40.060 --> 02:43:42.060
Number three load up the learning outcomes

02:43:42.220 --> 02:43:44.460
So lay out the learnables for each section of the video

02:43:44.620 --> 02:43:48.220
They should come fast and furious at the beginning front load the video to improve retention

02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:53.260
Number four make it personal. Why should I care?

02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:59.980
Either apply it to the viewer assuming the subject matter is broad enough or to yourself or Linus or someone recognizable

02:44:00.860 --> 02:44:05.500
Five ask questions out loud then answer them. This one is so important

02:44:06.300 --> 02:44:08.300
I expect if you are given a task

02:44:08.860 --> 02:44:14.060
That you will ask questions and then you will answer them out loud to me later

02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:18.460
And if you don't answer if you don't ask any questions, you won't get any answers

02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:24.780
And then I'm going to tell you why are you here giving me a report when you haven't asked any questions and you haven't found any answers

02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:27.500
Right. Um, I'm always fair

02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:29.820
You don't always want questions to be asked because you're busy

02:44:30.380 --> 02:44:34.860
No, no, I mean asking them to yourself. Oh, okay. Ask questions out loud then answer them

02:44:35.580 --> 02:44:40.940
Is is like for for videos like that. It's just such an effective storytelling technique. Yeah, no for sure. But Linus

02:44:41.820 --> 02:44:43.820
Why on earth would they have

02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:47.500
It shaped like this when a square would be so much

02:44:48.060 --> 02:44:54.540
More efficient to you know pack in next to each other and maximize volume. I'm so glad you asked the shape of a cylinder is

02:44:54.860 --> 02:44:56.860
You know, whatever, right

02:44:56.860 --> 02:44:59.820
Um maximizes the materials, you know, whatever

02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:01.660
um

02:45:01.660 --> 02:45:08.860
Number six provide context. It's not always obvious how good a screen is or amazing a microprocessor feature is

02:45:09.180 --> 02:45:14.140
Is it the price that makes it amazing? Why should I care? That one comes up a lot

02:45:14.780 --> 02:45:16.780
Number seven, remember who you're talking to

02:45:17.020 --> 02:45:20.380
Every video is a potential gateway drug that pulls the viewer deeply into the hobby

02:45:20.780 --> 02:45:23.820
But some videos have a more technical level of discourse than others

02:45:23.820 --> 02:45:29.100
So don't talk down to the audience about a highly technical subject, but don't always assume pre-existing knowledge

02:45:30.380 --> 02:45:32.380
Number eight plan for the payoff

02:45:32.700 --> 02:45:34.700
Know what the payoff will need to be

02:45:35.180 --> 02:45:40.460
So that the video culminates in something satisfying lord of the rings would have sucked if we never got to see mount doom

02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:43.660
Don't forget a negative outcome is still an outcome

02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:48.460
It's part of the journey and a journey can be an outcome. You just need to plan for it

02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:50.140
number nine

02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:52.140
Tell and show us how to feel

02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:55.500
And this is where this is from our internal documentation

02:45:55.980 --> 02:45:59.260
If you break it down 90 of youtube is reaction videos

02:46:00.140 --> 02:46:02.540
reacting to news or life or tech

02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:07.900
Don't tell me what's happening if you can show me how to feel what's happening

02:46:08.300 --> 02:46:14.860
So instead of and this is an example from a video where someone scripted it and brought it to me and I said, yeah, it's okay

02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:17.020
But here's how it needs to be

02:46:17.020 --> 02:46:22.380
Yeah, look at this pixel 6 5g in the corner, but when I type these digits and check phone information

02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:24.460
It says I'm on lte. What the heck?

02:46:24.940 --> 02:46:27.180
Why would I say all that when I can just say?

02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:30.460
But when I type this lte

02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:37.340
What the heck? I don't have to say check phone information. It says I'm on lte. I have to show emotion. I have to show you how to feel

02:46:38.060 --> 02:46:38.780
um

02:46:38.780 --> 02:46:40.780
number 10 have fun

02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:44.780
Fun is infectious and so is misery if you have a bad time making a video find a way to make it fun

02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:48.460
Or you will fail which will create more misery which will create more failure

02:46:48.860 --> 02:46:51.660
I think you complete it's very cool to go over

02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:56.380
Because the the video bible is awesome all that kind of stuff. I think you completely dodged the actual

02:46:57.020 --> 02:47:02.860
Maybe unintentionally, but the actual question that the person had though because you're giving an example of where you did

02:47:02.860 --> 02:47:06.220
Lay out what you want and they're asking how do I deal with when they don't?

02:47:07.580 --> 02:47:09.580
Well, what do I want that's not clear

02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:14.460
You often ask for things that aren't that clear. No, I mean no, I'm I tell me I'm

02:47:14.860 --> 02:47:19.980
Y'all what can I do better? You'll be like, oh, I want this thing. I I don't care. I don't actually mind this

02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:22.780
Okay, dan

02:47:23.180 --> 02:47:27.980
Oh, I have I have learned that you go I would like nebulous thing and I just

02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:31.180
I just do the nebulous thing

02:47:31.820 --> 02:47:36.780
Okay, and then it's normally the answer that I would give is try to look into the things that that person has

02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:42.780
Liked or valued in the past and try to take the tenets that you can take from that and apply it to what you're currently working on

02:47:42.940 --> 02:47:47.180
And do the best job you can it's a much more eloquent way to put what I tried to say

02:47:47.340 --> 02:47:52.380
It's it's I mean, it's all people relationships, right? Yeah, like yeah boss employee

02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:59.340
Friend or you know so or landlord or whatever your whole life is full of interactions with people

02:47:59.340 --> 02:48:01.740
But they're just people like if you look sorry

02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:05.580
Oh, I was just gonna say some so I think an example where I did give

02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:09.980
Just an endpoint and didn't provide a lot of guidance was whale land

02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:13.820
Yeah, I was like, let's have a land. It's gonna be sick

02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:19.900
People to interact. That's pretty much all we like said. Yeah, I think what I try and drill down to is like

02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:27.180
What do I think the end point of this thing that Linus wants is or why is he asking me to do this?

02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:28.780
Um

02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:33.500
Why is it important to him and then you can kind of base your entire task around that right?

02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:36.620
And if you don't agree then you need to get on the same page about the importance

02:48:36.620 --> 02:48:41.980
If you don't think it's important or you think something else is important if Linus is not correctly

02:48:42.860 --> 02:48:46.460
Articulated why it's important to him. That's when I would ask follow-up questions

02:48:46.940 --> 02:48:50.300
Like one example that I would give is look at creator warehouse products

02:48:50.940 --> 02:48:51.340
Sure

02:48:51.340 --> 02:48:56.060
If you look at a huge range of creative someone's like if you're like, hey, I want to whatever

02:48:56.460 --> 02:49:01.260
Would yeah, I want I want a lighter where it's the shape of a butt and it looks like the flame is coming out of the

02:49:01.260 --> 02:49:06.140
Butt and if you're wondering like how good it should be how effective it should be what materials

02:49:06.140 --> 02:49:08.940
You should use all that kind of stuff look into the other products on the store

02:49:09.340 --> 02:49:16.780
And you can probably figure out a like quality level design language for making this thing. Yeah, but lighter heirloom piece

02:49:17.740 --> 02:49:19.180
yes

02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:21.180
We will do my cat teaser at some point

02:49:21.900 --> 02:49:25.740
It's gonna be like if you were trying to make decisions on materials

02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:31.100
For the cat teaser thing. Yeah, you could probably figure out the direction to go in by looking at the other products on the store

02:49:31.260 --> 02:49:33.260
Like there's there's often

02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:36.140
Things around that can that can guide decisions

02:49:37.820 --> 02:49:40.540
Someone in full flame chat i'd consider buying that later

02:49:42.060 --> 02:49:44.060
Don't encourage him

02:49:44.780 --> 02:49:47.580
I'd have to uh high l l. Oh, yeah, uh

02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:53.580
Yeah, okay. Let's move on high l l d with the scrutiny of I guess censored content

02:49:53.820 --> 02:50:00.140
Should people on commissions also no sponsored content. Sorry it was cut off there. Uh, should people uh

02:50:01.020 --> 02:50:08.780
Let's try this again. Hi l l d with the scrutiny on sponsored content. Should people on commissions also be required to disclose

02:50:09.260 --> 02:50:14.780
Uh mortgage brokers travel agents often will have incentives from companies to promote their stuff

02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:23.180
I absolutely think so. Yeah. Yeah any kind of um, well, I mean we talked about this when we were talking about marketing the backpack recently

02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:29.180
Um, you know anytime there's a financial incentive to do anything there is supposed to be

02:50:29.420 --> 02:50:33.500
Uh disclosure. It's just a matter of how well regulated it is and how

02:50:34.220 --> 02:50:39.740
Uh, how cancelled someone will get if it turns out that they were not properly disclosing things

02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:46.860
Which these days seems to be not very cancelled because there's plenty of creators that participated in fairly egregious things

02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:51.660
Like crypto rug pulls or whatever else that seem to be not very cancelled at all somehow

02:50:51.660 --> 02:50:54.940
I don't I can't fathom it personally, but hey there you are. Yeah

02:50:55.260 --> 02:51:03.260
Love the show having grown to a hundred plus employees. How do you expect to balance being a business with being a relatable creator?

02:51:05.260 --> 02:51:07.260
Am I relatable anymore?

02:51:07.420 --> 02:51:13.020
I mean, there's certain things that we do intentional like here's something we've we've struggled a lot with uh, hey

02:51:13.020 --> 02:51:18.540
This is also from the how to write good videos document. It's not one of the 10 laws of Linus, but it's something

02:51:19.260 --> 02:51:21.260
Um

02:51:25.740 --> 02:51:27.740
Where is it?

02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:30.380
Oh

02:51:30.380 --> 02:51:32.380
I don't know. It seems to have been moved, but

02:51:32.940 --> 02:51:35.660
Basically, I I laid out a guideline

02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:41.420
For the writing team that basically says look we need to stop talking about money in subjective terms

02:51:41.900 --> 02:51:47.740
Um, and it was have I talked about this on wancho before? Yeah. Oh, okay, then never mind. Um, yeah

02:51:48.460 --> 02:51:52.300
I don't I don't know. It's tough because some days I feel completely out of touch

02:51:52.700 --> 02:51:54.700
like I said with the you know, just

02:51:55.260 --> 02:52:00.060
Sure, make it so for the three thousand dollar concrete pad for our, you know, six figure

02:52:00.700 --> 02:52:03.180
RF chamber, right? Like obviously that's not

02:52:03.900 --> 02:52:05.660
a real person

02:52:05.660 --> 02:52:09.100
Situation that they find themselves in but then other times

02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:14.540
You know, I have exactly the same challenges that you guys do like how do I manage?

02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:18.140
The time my kids are spending on their devices and

02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:21.100
You know, how do I make sure that?

02:52:21.500 --> 02:52:22.860
um

02:52:22.860 --> 02:52:24.860
You know, how do I how do I deal with a?

02:52:25.420 --> 02:52:31.020
You know crash when my when I launched this game on my computer, right? Like that no amount of

02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:34.060
money makes you immune to any of that no amount of

02:52:34.940 --> 02:52:40.540
People who work for you means that you don't have to you don't freak out when your server

02:52:40.780 --> 02:52:45.580
You know reboots and you all of a sudden your array is not showing up properly

02:52:45.660 --> 02:52:48.940
It's like yeah, just because you have a backup doesn't mean that it didn't just create a ton of work for you

02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:50.940
like I don't know there's

02:52:52.780 --> 02:52:59.180
I think the most important thing is to not get too far removed from the actual tech

02:52:59.900 --> 02:53:01.020
um

02:53:01.020 --> 02:53:03.180
And that's tough the more people that are here

02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:06.780
The more involved I am in administration, but I think that

02:53:07.420 --> 02:53:12.860
I might have some ideas for how to fix that and hopefully I'll be able to share them with you guys in the coming weeks

02:53:14.940 --> 02:53:21.980
Howdy lads going through a hard breakup right now your large library of long streams are a great distraction

02:53:22.780 --> 02:53:29.260
If you could change one thing in the history of technology, what would it be and why more stereoscopic 3d?

02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:31.420
I

02:53:34.300 --> 02:53:35.900
Don't know it's cool

02:53:35.900 --> 02:53:39.980
It's kind of still here. You know, it's just it kind of comes and goes right you got your vr now

02:53:40.380 --> 02:53:43.660
Is it fair to talk about software features when he's asking about technology sure?

02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:46.380
Uh microtransactions no

02:53:48.860 --> 02:53:54.380
Delete microtransactions is a pretty good answer. I like that me too. It's better than mine. That's a very noble answer

02:53:54.380 --> 02:53:56.380
I was just memeing

02:53:57.100 --> 02:53:59.100
Okay, last one of my curated today

02:54:00.620 --> 02:54:05.660
Now it's two I still run my 20 year old logitech 5.1 speakers

02:54:05.980 --> 02:54:09.900
It's better than being tethered to a headset and a lot of game support 5.1

02:54:10.300 --> 02:54:14.540
Letting me know when enemies are behind me. Why did Linus stop using these?

02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:17.900
Oh, uh, I moved in with my in-laws

02:54:18.620 --> 02:54:20.060
and

02:54:20.060 --> 02:54:23.740
They had tenants and so using speakers is

02:54:24.540 --> 02:54:29.660
Something I didn't I didn't really think about this when I lived in the middle of the boondocks in my parents house

02:54:30.380 --> 02:54:33.340
But using speakers is a privilege not a right

02:54:35.180 --> 02:54:41.340
And then I went from living very true. Yeah, I went from living with the in-laws to having children who

02:54:42.060 --> 02:54:43.180
sleep

02:54:43.180 --> 02:54:46.300
Nowadays, there's no real reason not to use speakers other than

02:54:47.180 --> 02:54:51.900
Single player gaming is not really much of a thing for me anymore. And when you're a multiplayer gamer

02:54:52.540 --> 02:54:54.540
Don't be that guy

02:54:54.620 --> 02:54:56.620
Don't be the guy with speakers

02:54:57.020 --> 02:54:58.300
Right

02:54:58.300 --> 02:55:04.620
So when the heck am I ever going to use speakers? Yeah, it ends up working for me that if I'm going to use speakers

02:55:05.340 --> 02:55:07.340
I could probably just play on the tv anyways

02:55:08.060 --> 02:55:10.220
So then it's like kind of a combination experience, you know

02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:18.460
Speaking of video games. Hello Linus. I'm happy to hear you finished horizon zero dawn. I hope you enjoyed it

02:55:18.540 --> 02:55:25.100
I did do you plan on playing horizon forbidden west anytime soon or will you be waiting for a pc desk launch?

02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:27.420
deck launch

02:55:27.420 --> 02:55:30.060
Why would I play it on a playstation?

02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:37.660
When I can play it later on a pc there is you know what this is this is like a funny thing that I feel like is really different

02:55:38.220 --> 02:55:40.220
between me and other people

02:55:40.780 --> 02:55:42.940
I don't need to do it now

02:55:43.660 --> 02:55:47.260
I don't need to watch the movie now. I don't need to play that game now

02:55:47.980 --> 02:55:51.980
My queue of games that I'm supposed to play is so

02:55:52.140 --> 02:55:56.380
Flipping deep that if I started and it was my full-time job to do nothing

02:55:56.380 --> 02:56:01.820
But play games that I want to play and are on my list of things to play or even in my steam library already

02:56:02.780 --> 02:56:04.140
It would be

02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:07.100
Probably a couple of years before I would get to anything current

02:56:08.220 --> 02:56:10.220
So if something new comes out

02:56:10.620 --> 02:56:12.620
What's the hurry?

02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:15.340
I

02:56:16.780 --> 02:56:20.620
It's fair and there's situations where that's totally not valid right?

02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:27.020
Being part of the initial launch of a new multiplayer game in particular and part of the

02:56:27.340 --> 02:56:32.380
The community and you know figuring out all the little the little tricks and stuff alongside everyone else

02:56:33.580 --> 02:56:37.180
That's that's huge. That's so fun. That's so engaging, right?

02:56:37.980 --> 02:56:39.980
But I

02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:44.380
I don't have it's tough to play competitive games for me these days. I'm just not that good

02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:47.900
And dude people are so sweaty these days

02:56:48.620 --> 02:56:49.740
like

02:56:49.740 --> 02:56:56.540
Whoa, it feels like man like over half the players are playing as if this could become their full-time job

02:56:56.940 --> 02:57:02.140
Like it's well look how many people work look how many people aspire to be streamers, right? It's true. Yeah

02:57:03.020 --> 02:57:05.020
I don't it looks rough

02:57:05.580 --> 02:57:07.580
I do not envy streamers

02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:12.860
Yeah, it's it's it's kind of weird like I feel like the amount of people that play multiplayer games casually

02:57:13.900 --> 02:57:19.180
When we were growing up used to be the majority and is absolutely the minority these days like it's

02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:22.460
It's kind of wild

02:57:22.540 --> 02:57:26.060
Hot take they've always been sweaty. I don't agree like at all actually

02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:30.460
Like if you I've brought up this analogy a bunch in the past actually and I think this

02:57:30.700 --> 02:57:35.020
Directly counters that point back in the day playing multiplayer RPG games

02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:39.740
If you got a fancy piece of armor or weapon, but it was ugly

02:57:40.380 --> 02:57:42.380
You wouldn't wear it

02:57:42.380 --> 02:57:45.500
If it was a stat upgrade, but you're like, ah, it looks gross

02:57:45.980 --> 02:57:48.780
People wouldn't put it on and this I'm not making this up a lot of

02:57:49.180 --> 02:57:54.700
Zoomer boys don't believe me, but it's actually a thing people would be like. Yeah, that's an upgrade

02:57:54.780 --> 02:57:56.780
But like I'm wearing entirely

02:57:57.660 --> 02:57:59.660
green armor and that's

02:58:00.300 --> 02:58:04.940
Orange or something and it just doesn't it doesn't fit. It doesn't look good. So I'll keep it in my bags

02:58:05.020 --> 02:58:07.020
Maybe I'll find stuff that works with it later

02:58:08.620 --> 02:58:11.020
And now it's like you'll you'll look like a

02:58:12.620 --> 02:58:19.580
Total random wardrobe person just as long as these things give better stats. You can compete harder

02:58:20.220 --> 02:58:23.740
Just ah, it's a very very different mentality

02:58:23.900 --> 02:58:29.980
Finally making my first LTT store.com purchase you've

02:58:30.540 --> 02:58:34.460
Occasionally mentioned applications and tools you use to make your work easier

02:58:34.940 --> 02:58:40.300
Do you use any particular human capital management software at LMG? Thanks y'all

02:58:44.220 --> 02:58:46.300
Was that for me? Yeah, I was reading sorry

02:58:47.340 --> 02:58:51.740
That could be both of you. I mean I didn't hear it. Uh, hcm software

02:58:52.620 --> 02:58:55.100
Hcm. I think it's like a HR software

02:58:56.620 --> 02:58:57.980
Uh

02:58:57.980 --> 02:59:02.380
Human capital management sounds horrifying. I don't like that term. It sure does

02:59:02.940 --> 02:59:07.820
Um, if the question was are we looking into it? I would say no because we don't know what it was. No

02:59:09.980 --> 02:59:14.700
Manage their employees from hire to retire. No, but I wouldn't be surprised if

02:59:15.660 --> 02:59:21.420
Like managing employees is absolutely a thing that you need to do and like onboarding and offboarding can be very

02:59:21.820 --> 02:59:25.100
complicated, especially without any form of automation or system to do so

02:59:25.500 --> 02:59:29.820
We didn't have any HR people until very recently. Uh, so maybe they'll

02:59:30.300 --> 02:59:33.980
Approach me about getting something like this at some point in the future. I wouldn't be too surprised

02:59:34.220 --> 02:59:36.220
I know they've been talking about certain

02:59:36.620 --> 02:59:38.620
implementations of of

02:59:38.860 --> 02:59:41.020
Different like online tools that they're already using

02:59:42.300 --> 02:59:44.300
So I don't know

02:59:44.540 --> 02:59:45.580
Maybe

02:59:45.580 --> 02:59:47.580
We are growing things happening

02:59:48.220 --> 02:59:50.540
Can we please have a way for digital only

02:59:50.940 --> 02:59:54.300
ltx pass holders to purchase a custom colored screwdriver?

02:59:54.620 --> 02:59:59.740
The flight and hotel cost would cost me nearly $2,000. I wouldn't mind a $60 tier

03:00:01.100 --> 03:00:03.100
um

03:00:03.420 --> 03:00:06.780
It's tough. It's very very tough to get those colorways out

03:00:07.500 --> 03:00:10.300
I think there's some things that if we're being completely realistic

03:00:10.940 --> 03:00:15.580
There isn't a feasible way for us to do it unless you come to the show and I know that's a tall ask

03:00:15.660 --> 03:00:20.540
And it's not going to work for everyone, but it doesn't mean that we shouldn't make it cool for the people that can show up

03:00:21.020 --> 03:00:25.900
Um, and you have talked about like maybe we'll put some extras up or something. They wouldn't be

03:00:26.780 --> 03:00:30.060
Build to order though. Absolutely not. There's be random colors

03:00:30.140 --> 03:00:36.540
There's just no way for us to handle that with our distribution and assembly partner. Yeah, and it's local like

03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:39.820
Someday someday

03:00:40.140 --> 03:00:41.500
maybe

03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:44.940
But it is not something that we're set up for right now if I had to

03:00:46.540 --> 03:00:49.260
I don't know if I want to throw this out there

03:00:49.900 --> 03:00:56.220
But hey here it goes. Um, you know if an enterprising individual who's going to be attending the show

03:00:56.940 --> 03:01:02.860
Wanted to coordinate with people who can't attend the show and buy more than one in person

03:01:03.100 --> 03:01:05.100
You know that all sounds very

03:01:05.660 --> 03:01:07.980
community oriented and all that

03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:12.700
Uh, but we're not gonna we're not going to allow people to buy a hundred drivers either

03:01:13.020 --> 03:01:18.380
So don't kid yourself. You're not going to be showing up and like buying our entire stock and like, you know making a

03:01:19.180 --> 03:01:20.940
A side hustle business out of doing this

03:01:20.940 --> 03:01:25.100
But if if people show up and they buy like two or three and we're not going to tell them no

03:01:25.740 --> 03:01:28.780
So I'd say that might be a way maybe find someone who's going

03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:31.660
Sorry

03:01:33.180 --> 03:01:37.740
Linus being a supreme commander player and being alive for as long as you have

03:01:38.220 --> 03:01:46.300
I assume you've also experienced total annihilation and it's amazing music. What's your favorite or favorites video game soundtrack?

03:01:47.260 --> 03:01:49.260
Oh, wow, that's a good question

03:01:49.260 --> 03:01:55.100
Do you have a favorite video game soundtrack for a long time? It was the bastion soundtrack. I liked that a lot

03:01:55.660 --> 03:01:57.660
Um, I used to run to that all the time

03:01:58.460 --> 03:02:03.900
Um, I've spent so much time listening to final fantasy 6. I never ever get sick of it

03:02:04.620 --> 03:02:09.980
Um, but like there's some there's some just amazing like main theme songs

03:02:10.860 --> 03:02:15.740
Like if I just had to pick, you know, biggest bangers like obviously, you know, halo's got to be up there

03:02:17.100 --> 03:02:21.260
You know, like it's just the halo intro is sick. It's so good, right?

03:02:21.340 --> 03:02:24.060
I've often been into music without lyrics because

03:02:24.620 --> 03:02:29.660
That's exactly enough distraction for me that I can stay focused on things. Well the second you have lyrics

03:02:29.740 --> 03:02:31.740
I start saying them in my head

03:02:31.980 --> 03:02:33.980
And it's bad

03:02:33.980 --> 03:02:37.020
So I used to like I would just put on like the ftl soundtrack

03:02:37.900 --> 03:02:42.220
But I don't think it's necessarily even that great. It was just something that I had heard a lot because I liked that game

03:02:42.700 --> 03:02:47.180
Um for like chill vibes. I used to like the the grizzly hills ambience

03:02:48.060 --> 03:02:50.860
Um, just random stuff like that. I don't know

03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:53.660
Nobody's talking about metal gear rise

03:02:53.820 --> 03:02:58.300
My birds listen to the assassin's creed 4 c shanties all the time

03:02:59.420 --> 03:03:01.500
Always are they're video calling each other?

03:03:02.300 --> 03:03:04.300
I wish that is so cool

03:03:04.380 --> 03:03:08.300
Okay, last one I have here in the curated question for Linus in retrospect

03:03:08.460 --> 03:03:14.220
Did the roast of Linus Sebastian hurt in the moment? How do you feel about it watching it back if you ever do?

03:03:14.620 --> 03:03:18.380
Not was hilarious and it's still hilarious. Um, there's so much

03:03:19.500 --> 03:03:21.980
Far too much truth in there. Um

03:03:24.780 --> 03:03:26.300
So good

03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:28.300
Yeah, that's a proper roast. It should be truthful

03:03:29.260 --> 03:03:33.100
Um, and now we're into potentials with you guys every time I watch it back

03:03:33.260 --> 03:03:39.100
I forget things that happened and just burst out laughing. Yeah, it's so funny

03:03:39.980 --> 03:03:41.180
Oh man

03:03:41.180 --> 03:03:45.660
Hi Linus and Luke. I really admire your leadership skills as a business owner

03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:51.260
How do you go about developing your leadership skills and the philosophy that lets you guide your decision making?

03:03:52.700 --> 03:03:55.580
I mean honestly so much of it just comes down to the golden rule

03:03:56.300 --> 03:03:57.420
like

03:03:57.420 --> 03:03:59.420
Maybe part of it is just

03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:05.500
Because I did used to work as a low-level employee and I do remember it like it just seems

03:04:05.980 --> 03:04:10.620
It seems kind of common sense. Um, you know, say please say thank you

03:04:11.340 --> 03:04:13.580
Um, you know, don't make people

03:04:14.540 --> 03:04:18.380
Feel like they're being dismissed if they need to be dismissed

03:04:18.940 --> 03:04:20.940
Acknowledge that you know

03:04:20.940 --> 03:04:23.500
Explain why you have to do it make time later

03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:25.820
Like just I don't know just

03:04:26.540 --> 03:04:28.540
Don't be rude

03:04:28.780 --> 03:04:30.780
It's all Bill and Ted, right?

03:04:30.860 --> 03:04:32.860
Be excellent to each other

03:04:34.220 --> 03:04:36.620
And if you if you can't if you screw up sometimes

03:04:37.260 --> 03:04:41.980
What what is what is up with people and thinking apologizing is not cool anymore

03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:50.140
Like, you know back backing down, you know, you should never apologize like what's up with that

03:04:51.020 --> 03:04:56.620
If you make a mistake current thing, I don't think I've seen that. Yeah, you know, no, it's it's a thing in certain

03:04:57.420 --> 03:05:04.220
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I think it's really dumb toxic masculinity. I don't know. It's toxic something toxic something

03:05:05.180 --> 03:05:13.500
I've been shopping for a new ultra-wide monitor and I'm struggling to figure out the differences between hdr 10 or 400 or whatever

03:05:14.380 --> 03:05:16.380
Oh

03:05:16.540 --> 03:05:24.300
I see so hdr 400 is nonsense hdr 600 is okay hdr 1000 is pretty good and those are

03:05:24.860 --> 03:05:32.220
The capabilities of your display and then there's also the like OLED version where 600 and up is is pretty good actually

03:05:32.860 --> 03:05:34.220
um

03:05:34.220 --> 03:05:36.620
As for hdr 10 versus dolby

03:05:37.340 --> 03:05:39.740
Uh dolby vision versus hlg

03:05:40.700 --> 03:05:46.220
That just comes down to whatever content you're going to be consuming and uh, which format it was

03:05:47.820 --> 03:05:53.180
Mastered in so it all comes down to what content you'll be consuming hdr 10 plus

03:05:53.900 --> 03:06:00.860
Seems like it might kind of win, but dolby vision still doing pretty good and then hlg I think has pretty good support in tv

03:06:00.860 --> 03:06:02.380
So there's no clear

03:06:02.380 --> 03:06:05.980
winner and what we really need is someone to at this point to develop a

03:06:06.460 --> 03:06:08.780
A metadata interpreting middleware

03:06:09.500 --> 03:06:15.100
For the metadata interpreting standards so that you can just interpret all of them correctly. I don't know

03:06:15.820 --> 03:06:20.140
There's devices like that for home theater use that will take whatever content and then

03:06:20.700 --> 03:06:23.340
You know adjust it so that every frame is is

03:06:23.900 --> 03:06:28.620
Perfectly balanced within the capabilities of your display, but they're like shockingly expensive still I think

03:06:29.340 --> 03:06:35.820
Now there's one that I accidentally got rid of do you think we'll ever see a return of 3ds type screens on more mainstream devices?

03:06:35.820 --> 03:06:38.140
Like phones or a steam deck competitor next gen switch

03:06:38.860 --> 03:06:45.820
Um, we're going to see 3d laptops with glasses free 3d. Um, I've seen prototypes in person

03:06:45.820 --> 03:06:52.460
They look shockingly good. I don't know that they'll go mainstream. I think they might be more professional, but yeah, they're really good

03:06:53.820 --> 03:06:58.060
Okay, last for you here. Hey dll given the variations for the wan hoodie

03:06:58.220 --> 03:07:02.140
What is the likelihood that we will see different color ways for the windbreaker?

03:07:02.300 --> 03:07:05.740
I've noticed linea seems to wear the short circuit hoodie most often now

03:07:12.380 --> 03:07:15.020
Oh, sorry one second. I missed a little bit of that

03:07:15.980 --> 03:07:17.980
You're going to get new colors for the wan hoodie

03:07:19.500 --> 03:07:21.500
Not anytime soon

03:07:22.700 --> 03:07:25.340
No, it's going to be when in short circuit for quite a while

03:07:25.900 --> 03:07:28.300
Hey dll as a fold four user

03:07:28.300 --> 03:07:33.020
My biggest gripe is whenever I fold it closed it closes the app and kicks me to the home screen

03:07:33.340 --> 03:07:35.820
Does yours do this as well? It's a setting

03:07:36.380 --> 03:07:38.220
Uh, there's you'll have to look it up

03:07:38.220 --> 03:07:44.780
But in the settings you can tell it which apps app by app you want to continue where you left off if you close the phone

03:07:45.260 --> 03:07:47.260
That's the default behavior though is what you're seeing

03:07:47.900 --> 03:07:49.500
Hi me from the future

03:07:49.500 --> 03:07:55.020
Linus you mentioned during a beat saber live stream that you were trying the big screen beyond and it had

03:07:55.100 --> 03:07:59.420
Some issues have you tested it since and what's your review of it? It's super cool

03:08:00.700 --> 03:08:05.100
Um, I actually I have a bunch of notes on it and I I I think either

03:08:05.820 --> 03:08:11.180
Either adam from the writing team has not kept up with talking to them or they haven't replied

03:08:11.660 --> 03:08:15.660
Either way, I you know, I want to cover it at some point, but it's been kind of stalled

03:08:16.860 --> 03:08:19.740
Um, so I can just tell you guys what I have down so far

03:08:21.100 --> 03:08:22.940
I think

03:08:22.940 --> 03:08:24.940
No, I don't see the dock

03:08:25.740 --> 03:08:29.180
Big screen is it big screen one word? I don't know. I made a bunch of notes

03:08:29.500 --> 03:08:33.820
Basically the fineness of the display is amazing the contrast of the displays

03:08:34.540 --> 03:08:38.620
So amazing really really cool. Yeah, I can't find my dock doesn't matter

03:08:39.340 --> 03:08:40.380
um

03:08:40.380 --> 03:08:43.900
But there's some issues with the lenses where they kind of lens flare

03:08:44.620 --> 03:08:47.420
On bright objects that I find pretty distracting

03:08:47.740 --> 03:08:50.220
And I'm having an issue that might have been resolved by now

03:08:50.220 --> 03:08:54.540
But I was having an issue with the mic a few weeks back that made it so that if any

03:08:55.580 --> 03:08:59.340
Application was using the onboard usbc audio device

03:08:59.980 --> 03:09:05.340
Uh, the microphone wouldn't work in obs so I couldn't hear my game and also stream

03:09:06.220 --> 03:09:09.660
So I was like, well, this is stupid. I'm not going to use this

03:09:10.620 --> 03:09:13.180
I love the lightweight. I love the the custom fit

03:09:13.980 --> 03:09:17.420
But there's there's just a deal breaker that I can't deal with for now

03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:25.340
I think there's four incoming merge messages that are all linus related and then we're

03:09:26.540 --> 03:09:28.540
Oh, but yeah doneers

03:09:29.100 --> 03:09:31.100
Uh, okay

03:09:32.460 --> 03:09:34.620
Ooh, can you give us some linus text tips?

03:09:35.740 --> 03:09:42.780
Uh, I'm gonna go full boomer and say use lots of emojis. Nice. Nice lots of like colon p and you know

03:09:43.740 --> 03:09:49.340
Hmm, you know tongue. I don't I miss a motocons. I hate emojis. Me too. I wish they would not

03:09:49.980 --> 03:09:53.580
Auto convert as off tribes mean nuts. They have more emotion

03:09:54.540 --> 03:09:55.980
Yeah

03:09:55.980 --> 03:10:01.820
How are you liking your pebble? Do you plan on paying the $3 monthly fee for rebels voice transcription and weather services?

03:10:02.540 --> 03:10:07.820
I still haven't taken the 10 minutes to figure out how rebel works and side load the pebble app

03:10:08.060 --> 03:10:10.380
So I've actually just been wearing it ornamentally

03:10:10.620 --> 03:10:13.980
I will get around to it at some point

03:10:15.020 --> 03:10:17.740
I'm pretty sure watches are just fashion accessories at this point

03:10:19.260 --> 03:10:23.340
Um, I think I think nick like seriously uses his but he's the only person I know that does

03:10:24.860 --> 03:10:29.260
Ethan honestly, I don't know what to tell you other than that. It's really tough sometimes

03:10:31.020 --> 03:10:34.300
I just get distracted and stuff languages

03:10:35.420 --> 03:10:36.860
um

03:10:36.860 --> 03:10:41.820
Are there any other companies you draw inspiration from in conducting business?

03:10:43.980 --> 03:10:45.980
Most are kind of sucky

03:10:46.380 --> 03:10:50.460
Knocktula is a big one. I like their I like their philosophy when it comes to

03:10:51.180 --> 03:10:53.180
Only releasing products when they're ready

03:10:54.060 --> 03:10:56.220
Are there any that you draw inspiration from?

03:10:56.860 --> 03:10:58.140
um

03:10:58.140 --> 03:10:59.340
honestly

03:10:59.340 --> 03:11:02.540
No, it's kind of hard to get inspiration for the type of stuff that

03:11:03.340 --> 03:11:04.540
we do

03:11:04.540 --> 03:11:05.340
um

03:11:05.340 --> 03:11:11.740
When like everyone in the space is chasing VC money and buyouts, I mean you could say the opposite

03:11:12.060 --> 03:11:12.860
um

03:11:12.860 --> 03:11:16.780
They're inspiring because they're doing bad and you want to do what they're not doing bad though

03:11:17.340 --> 03:11:21.660
No, I would say they're doing bad. I am. I know a lot of people that are doing great

03:11:21.900 --> 03:11:27.420
Following models that aren't ours third line. This is you know, they're sucky as he said. Yeah, maybe

03:11:28.460 --> 03:11:32.380
Last one. I swiped away a thing. Um, have you ever heard of the black mages?

03:11:32.700 --> 03:11:38.140
It's a metal rock band that covers final fantasy soundtrack. I'm sure Conrad has I haven't I'm afraid

03:11:38.460 --> 03:11:42.700
Uh thoughts on a motherboard throw cover for couches with the cp. Pill. Yeah, we wanted to do a blanket

03:11:42.860 --> 03:11:45.500
But all the samples we got were awful. So we didn't

03:11:46.300 --> 03:11:47.820
And that was that

03:11:47.820 --> 03:11:50.140
Um glad you like your shirt travis

03:11:51.260 --> 03:11:54.540
Show archive. I can't do anything with that one for some reason. Oh, and it's gone

03:11:54.940 --> 03:11:59.420
Uh, do you have any plans on making a mask for the windbreaker to protect your face against rain and wind?

03:12:00.380 --> 03:12:05.420
No, I can't say that ever occurred to me probably not any time soon and

03:12:06.220 --> 03:12:08.220
Hey, are you gonna be on time for your thing? Yeah

03:12:11.020 --> 03:12:16.220
Thanks for tuning in we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel. Bye

03:12:29.660 --> 03:12:31.660
Oh

03:12:43.820 --> 03:12:50.220
Like the composer of like most of the oh well, yeah, that's cool. It's not just like random

03:12:55.420 --> 03:12:57.420
Okay, and we're up

03:12:59.420 --> 03:13:01.420
Go away from this

03:13:01.580 --> 03:13:03.580
Okay
