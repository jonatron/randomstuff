<h2>Beating Jeff's 3.14 Ghz Raspberry Pi 5</h2>

<p>Jeff came up against a 1V limit in his video 
  &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTIkZBsVJyA&t=931s"> Overclocking Raspberry Pi 5 to 3.14 GHz on Pi Day </a>&quot;
after <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1876">firmware</a> was released to remove the 3Ghz limit.

<p>There's a silicon lottery, and I tried to see what I could get on my particular Pi.
  Geekbench takes ages to run and has a large run-to-run variance.
  <br>
  <pre>sysbench cpu run</pre> allows me to iterate more quickly.
  I'm using this cooler, and I haven't tried any other cooling solutions. <br>

</pre>

<p>arm_freq=3300 or 3.3Ghz is where it gets very unstable.

<h2>Firmware</h2>

<p>The 1V limit is in the firmware. The Raspberry Pi is weird, because it starts by running code on the VPU/GPU. It's an obscure Brodcom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VideoCore">VideoCore</a> instruction set.

<p>There's a <a href="https://pip.raspberrypi.com/categories/685-whitepapers-app-notes/documents/RP-004651-WP/Raspberry-Pi-4-Boot-Security.pdf">PDF</a>
 documenting the Raspberry Pi 4 boot security.

<p>Basically the first 3 boot stages are BOOTROM (AKA BL0), bootsys, and bootmain. Bootrom is baked into the CPU, bootsys and bootmain are signed, so I can't modify them without the signing key, which I don't have. Somehow I doubt Raspberry Pi or Broadcom would hand me the keys.
  There's some differences between the
  <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-4-and-raspberry-pi-5-boot-flow">Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 boot process.</a>

<p>There are some tools to parse and extract the Raspberry Pi 5 firmware (stored on the eeprom):

  <br><a href="https://github.com/info-beamer/rpi-eeprom-tools">https://github.com/info-beamer/rpi-eeprom-tools</a>
  <br><a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/">https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/</a>

<p>Handily, a Github user made <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/1147">Ghidra support for Videocore</a>.

<p>Searching bootmain for "volt", I found what looks a lot like a voltage limiter.

<p><img src="ghid.png">

<p>A single mov.cc instruction can be patched to remove the voltage limit. However, it's in bootmain, which is signed, so we can't just patch bootmain and flash the eeprom.
<p>However, as a root linux user on Raspberry Pi full access to system memory, including memory used by the videocore. I mmap'd /dev/vc-mem, searched for the instruction and replaced it, but i'll leave that as an exercise to the reader. I don't want people blaming me if their Pi decides to halt and catch fire.

<h2>Slowing down before I speed up</h2>

<p>If I set arm_freq=3300, it isn't stable. Also, I can't use force_turbo. To get it usable, I limited the cpu to 2.9Ghz as early as possible:

<pre><b>/lib/systemd/system/slowcpu.service</b></pre>
<br>

<pre>
[Unit]
Description=Slow CPU
Before=basic.target
After=local-fs.target sysinit.target
DefaultDependencies=no

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash /slowcpu

[Install]
WantedBy=basic.target
</pre>
<br>
<pre><b>/slowcpu</b></pre>
<br>
<pre>echo 2900000 | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq</pre>
<br>
<br><pre>sudo systemctl enable slowcpu.service</pre>

<p>From there, I can remove the voltage limit:
  <br><pre>sudo ./removelimit && vcgencmd cache_flush</pre>

<p>Then I can put the frequency limit back up to 3.3Ghz
  <br><pre>echo 3300000 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq</pre>

<p>And make it like force_turbo was on:
  <br><pre>echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor</pre>

<p>Checking my voltage and clock with over_voltage_delta=60000:
<br>
<pre>
$ vcgencmd measure_volts
volt=1.0437V
$ vcgencmd measure_clock arm
frequency(0)=3300034816
</pre>

<p>After all that...</p>

  <br>
  <pre>
    total number of events:              37713
    total number of events:              37712
  </pre>

<p>...That wasn't worth it.
