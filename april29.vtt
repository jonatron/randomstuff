WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.920
Oh look at that new notification, so clean, so fresh, so exciting.

00:21.920 --> 00:26.000
Icewind Dale Enhanced Edition has been mentioned in the full plain chat, wonderful game.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
I remember when I realized that you could duplicate things in that game, because when you were,

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
if you created a new game, you could import characters.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Sorry, what game are we talking about?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Icewind Dale, it's very old.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Oh.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
So this old RPG that I used to play on one of my dad's computers before I even built my own.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
And you could have your group or whatever, and you could import a character from another save,

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
drop all their stuff, and then boot the character out, and then import them again, and drop all their stuff again.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Of course you could.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
That is amazing.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
The cloud would strike you down for doing it now.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Alright.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
No wait, I care.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
One sec.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
You might just have to send the stream key to me.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Alright.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Okay.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
We ready?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Should we just go for it?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Sure.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Do I take your thumbs up to mean okay?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Oh yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Alright.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I mean it seems fine to me.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Sure, okay.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Do we need to?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I don't know.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
If you think we need to, then it seems fine to me.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah, I think it's fine.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Okay.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Okay.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, I guess let's just do it.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
I really have got to get this mic situation figured out.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
You too.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
You hunch a lot to reach your mic.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
You like put it low and then you lean.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, but like then it covers the screen because the screen's so low.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
I know you wouldn't believe how much of my screen this mic is in front of right now.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, like I can't see anything.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
I don't know.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I mean I'm not saying I blame you.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm just saying like five hours sometimes of like...

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Nope, not necessary.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
That's why when I stand up after Wancho, that is the most like broken I feel the entire week.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Like, man, I can sit and work all day and I feel fine.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
I sit up after like three hours of Wancho and I'm like, I'm broken.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
I think I also, I sit like this for like a huge portion of it.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I think that's part of it.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
All right.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
You're also very quiet at times in the streams.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Linus and I are both not very easy to do audio for.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
I boosted you a bit this week as well as myself, people complaining about my...

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
I saw that too.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
I think I'm going to have it like here.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
The problem is that I have to type things sometimes.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
So we'll see if that causes an issue.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Are those blues?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh, you wish they were blues.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
What are they?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
I think they're browns.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
I asked in the chat today if I could have a quiet keyboard.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
That probably makes sense.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
I'm probably going to have Ploof design as something custom.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Why?

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
We don't have a quiet, what do you mean?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
We'll just order one.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, I don't think we have one.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
That does not sound like a good use of his time.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
It's not a good use of anyone's time.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
We'll probably just buy one.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
I've heard, I don't know from who, but I heard making videos is like hard.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Who said that?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I don't know.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Okay.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm just going to start the thing because this is clearly leading nowhere.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Discussion?

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
No, we're waiting for you.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
All right, I'm clicking it.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
Resuming the selected.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Is this the same as last week?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
My bad.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
I don't know.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I do laundry.

04:56.000 --> 05:06.000
What is up, everyone?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
And welcome to the one show.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
We've got a lot of great topics for you today, starting with the passing of controversial

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Bill C 11 here in Canada.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
Or should I call it Canuckistan?

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
I mean, I've heard people call it worse, especially people who are not in Canada and don't really

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
understand what being in Canada is all about.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
But that doesn't mean that C 11 isn't a cause for concern.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
We're going to be talking about that.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Also a cause for concern.

05:37.000 --> 05:44.000
AMD's Ryzen X 3D CPUs have been dying, though they've apparently rolled out a fix now.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
So we're going to get you guys the update on what's going on with that.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
What else we got?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm looking for stuff.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
You want to talk about dead Chromebooks?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Oh, sure.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
What?

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
You don't want to talk about my impending cosmetic procedure?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Cheap laptops die and are annoying to repair.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I mean, yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
More at 11.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Impending cosmetic procedure.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
What?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Well, let's just leave it there.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
What?

06:08.000 --> 06:31.000
The show is brought to you today by MSI, Vessie, and AkiFlow.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
All right, let's jump right into obviously the big topic of the week.

06:36.000 --> 06:50.000
Should we just abandon our Canadian roots, make the long trek 36 minutes to the southern

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
border and join one of our former colleagues down in Americaville?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Former colleagues.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
John moved down there.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Oh, I thought you were talking about John.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Oh, yeah.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
No, he's former colleague.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah, no, he still works here.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I mean, well, not here here, but here here.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
The greater here.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Let's talk about why this is even a topic of conversation.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.680
Bill C-11 has been passed into Canadian law as the online streaming act after two and

07:21.680 --> 07:27.320
a half years of debate, a debate that I actually did get involved in at one point back when

07:27.320 --> 07:33.520
it was known as C-10, making my way all the way to the assistant deputy minister.

07:33.520 --> 07:37.720
No, I think it was the deputy minister of whoever was actually working on this.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.720
I can't remember.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.480
It's actually been quite a while.

07:40.480 --> 07:45.360
I remember being on the set of one of our early car videos might have been the Model

07:45.360 --> 07:53.760
Y video or something like that, and I had this call on the racetrack with this deputy

07:53.760 --> 07:56.680
minister or whatever.

07:56.680 --> 08:03.440
It became very clear to me at that time that, well, okay, this won't be a surprise to anyone

08:03.800 --> 08:07.760
but it became very clear to me that the whole thing was political, had nothing to do with

08:07.760 --> 08:13.640
actually protecting creators or however they were trying to sell it.

08:13.640 --> 08:19.240
At the end of the day was about figuring out a way to extract money from online streaming

08:19.240 --> 08:26.440
platforms and then as far as I could tell, waste it.

08:26.440 --> 08:32.640
I have a lot of thoughts based on my experience, both with Canadian production services tax

08:32.680 --> 08:38.560
credits, as well as just generally interfacing with the government of Canada.

08:38.560 --> 08:44.280
As far as I can tell, most of the funding exists only for entities that are so large

08:44.280 --> 08:49.960
and well-established that they can afford both the time and money to cut through bureaucracy

08:49.960 --> 08:51.920
and therefore don't need it.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.360
It's a lot of work.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.800
The companies that I know that capture it very effectively have dedicated employees

08:56.800 --> 08:58.640
that are there to capture it.

08:58.640 --> 09:03.640
Which is, like, oh man, not the point.

09:03.640 --> 09:07.640
Anywho, let's go back to the talking point, shall we?

09:07.640 --> 09:12.560
Originally known as Bill C-10, the act allows the Canadian government to impose regulations

09:12.560 --> 09:17.200
on streaming platforms like Netflix and Spotify as well as social platforms like YouTube,

09:17.200 --> 09:21.440
Facebook and TikTok through the Canadian Radio, Television and Telecommunications Commission

09:21.440 --> 09:23.240
or the CRTC.

09:23.240 --> 09:28.840
Proponents say, so these would be supporters, that C-11 simply brings online platforms under

09:28.840 --> 09:34.040
the same kind of rules that have applied to traditional broadcasters for decades, requiring

09:34.040 --> 09:40.560
them to promote Canadian content and contribute financially to Canadian content production.

09:40.560 --> 09:44.640
But critics, including many Canadian content creators like Renee Ritchie, some ordinary

09:44.640 --> 09:48.800
gamers called me Chris and JJ McCullough, are worried that the law could affect content

09:48.800 --> 09:54.200
that's made by influencers slash content creators, like independent creators, since

09:54.200 --> 09:58.640
the act will likely force platforms to change their recommendation algorithms to serve Canadian

09:58.640 --> 10:02.760
users more CanCon or Canadian content.

10:02.760 --> 10:10.000
And this is a very real concern, not just because of the moves the Canadian government

10:10.000 --> 10:16.440
is making, but because of what I fear an entity like Google might do to retaliate.

10:16.440 --> 10:20.640
So let's, and you know what?

10:20.640 --> 10:29.080
This is a tough one for me to approach, because these are all private conversations, but no

10:29.080 --> 10:35.200
one said anything to me directly, because that would have been insane, but I will tell

10:35.200 --> 10:42.040
you from conversations I have participated in, whether directly or observationally, that

10:42.040 --> 10:48.680
Google's not happy about any of this, and that if they are forced to alter the way that

10:48.680 --> 10:56.320
they serve content to Canadian viewers, they might, you know, you never know something

10:56.320 --> 11:02.840
might happen to the way that content from Canadian creators gets served outside of Canada.

11:02.840 --> 11:07.560
Yeah, like it sounds all neat for Canadian creators when you hear what Canada wants,

11:07.560 --> 11:11.960
but when you think about how anybody's going to react to it, your algorithmic priority outside

11:11.960 --> 11:18.720
of Canada is going to be damaged because of your algorithmic priority inside of Canada.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.800
Potentially, potentially.

11:20.800 --> 11:27.880
And I'd say I've been in none of these conversations, so I would say probably, but I have no idea.

11:27.880 --> 11:34.440
Well, see, the thing is, even if Google decided, you know what, forget it, what's the point

11:34.440 --> 11:37.520
of being petty and spiteful here?

11:37.520 --> 11:43.440
If LTT's viewership is 6% within Canada, why would we want this to have any impact on

11:43.440 --> 11:47.920
their ability for their content to propagate outside of Canada?

11:47.920 --> 11:50.200
Why are we depriving other users of this content?

11:50.200 --> 11:53.960
I mean, that's ridiculous, but hold on a second.

11:53.960 --> 12:00.400
If the Canadian government passes this law, which they now have, and decides to actually

12:00.400 --> 12:06.560
do something with it, which at this point is still very unclear, actually, well, they

12:06.600 --> 12:16.000
probably won't be the last, I mean, if I'm Turkey or Japan or anywhere, really, anywhere

12:16.000 --> 12:24.560
that's more of a cultural importer, rather than exporter, and I'm anywhere that I want

12:24.560 --> 12:31.120
to protect my local production industry, well, I'm looking at this going, oh, okay.

12:31.120 --> 12:35.680
So you actually can just tell Big Tech, no, you may not have a closed black box algorithm

12:35.800 --> 12:43.760
that just kind of recommends whatever and doesn't promote local or at least within arbitrary

12:43.760 --> 12:46.120
geographical boundary X content.

12:47.840 --> 12:54.480
And so ultimately, the impact could end up coming for us, not because of Canada's first

12:54.480 --> 13:01.440
move on this, but because of the other dominoes that may ultimately fall over the next two

13:01.440 --> 13:05.960
or five or 10 or 25 years or whatever that timeframe ends up looking like.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.640
Let's do continue here, though.

13:10.280 --> 13:15.280
The government has said, the Canadian government, to be clear, has said that the act is not meant,

13:15.280 --> 13:20.000
this is italicized, thank you, Wanshoe writer, to affect user generated content.

13:20.680 --> 13:24.520
So it theoretically shouldn't affect someone like a call me Chris.

13:24.920 --> 13:30.120
But then, in spite of them saying that they rejected multiple amendments that would have

13:30.120 --> 13:32.400
specified that in the law.

13:32.720 --> 13:40.920
So as it is now, it's pretty much just left to the CRTC to decide how to enforce this.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.840
And if they do ultimately go that route with it, well, that's within their power.

13:45.040 --> 13:51.600
So the law was designed to give the CRTC as broad powers as they were able to get pushed

13:51.600 --> 13:53.160
through over the last two and a half years.

13:53.480 --> 14:00.880
And as an independent content creator that more and more, at least according to many

14:00.880 --> 14:04.760
of you, is basically a corporate media machine.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.000
I have no idea where I fall in this.

14:09.400 --> 14:13.320
How does Linus Media Group, Incorporated, figure into this?

14:13.360 --> 14:17.920
Am I an independent content creator or am I a media corporation?

14:19.120 --> 14:21.640
Both? I think both is good.

14:21.960 --> 14:22.680
Yeah, I don't know.

14:23.760 --> 14:28.560
Right? Okay, so let's keep moving on.

14:28.840 --> 14:33.680
One uncontroversial effect of the law could be the widening, though, of the definition

14:33.680 --> 14:36.360
of what legally constitutes Canadian content.

14:36.880 --> 14:41.280
Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is reportedly likely to ask the CRTC to include

14:41.280 --> 14:48.320
content such as Pixar's Turning Red, which is an American movie produced by an American

14:48.320 --> 14:54.560
company, but written by a Canadian set in Toronto and produced by a partially Canadian

14:54.560 --> 14:59.560
crew and also HBO's The Handmaid's Tale, which is an American show set partially in

14:59.560 --> 15:05.200
Canada and based on books by a, Luke, your phone, and based on books by a Canadian author

15:05.240 --> 15:07.000
with a partially Canadian crew.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.880
Neither of those would qualify under the current CanCon rules.

15:11.040 --> 15:15.480
What's really stupid about the current CanCon rules is how difficult it is to prove it.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.640
Like, look at this ridiculous.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.840
What is a Canadian certification?

15:20.840 --> 15:23.480
Minimum of 75% of program expenses, blah, blah, blah.

15:23.480 --> 15:24.600
OK, what is the points?

15:24.600 --> 15:25.640
What is the point system?

15:25.640 --> 15:27.440
OK, so the director gives you two points.

15:29.040 --> 15:34.400
DP gives you one point, I mean, or two points, depending on what kind you're talking about.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.280
But the director of photography gives you one point.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.120
There's some special rules.

15:39.880 --> 15:43.560
The point is just like the single point.

15:44.080 --> 15:48.800
The government hasn't been super clear about how this is going to work because they aren't

15:48.800 --> 15:50.200
the ones making the actual rules.

15:50.200 --> 15:54.360
That's the job of the CRTC, who are going to take consultation for 30 days at least

15:54.440 --> 15:56.440
before publishing a draft.

15:57.840 --> 16:02.160
So our discussion questions are as follows.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.440
Oh, this is fun.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.280
How will the government force platforms to finance Canadian content?

16:07.280 --> 16:10.520
I mean, this that's a really interesting one, because so far.

16:11.520 --> 16:16.840
If Google simply says, well, I'm not going to pay, I don't think that the Canadian

16:16.840 --> 16:22.000
government has shown any inclination to simply block Google services within the borders.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.720
So that would be so incredibly destructive.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.920
Yeah, yeah, that would be that would be pretty bad and pretty stupid.

16:28.760 --> 16:33.880
However, again, this is from my conversations that I've witnessed slash been a part of.

16:33.880 --> 16:39.040
It is my understanding that Google intends to comply with whatever law ultimately ends up

16:39.800 --> 16:40.800
happening.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.720
So C11, they intend to comply with C11.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.960
So I guess, you know, that's not a probable outcome.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.120
So then what will that look like?

16:50.040 --> 16:56.080
Is it potentially a good thing that we could get more because, OK, if they have to alter

16:56.080 --> 17:00.040
the algorithm, they have to somehow demonstrate that they're altering the algorithm.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.120
They have to be more transparent about how it works.

17:04.120 --> 17:07.960
Does that have a potential small upside here for everyone?

17:08.320 --> 17:12.720
And the thing that I don't really understand is, like, if I go to YouTube, I wonder if

17:12.720 --> 17:15.200
this is going to happen here because it's logged into a different account.

17:17.360 --> 17:18.320
It did not happen here.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.440
And I don't know if this is because I click on this content sometimes or what.

17:21.680 --> 17:25.200
But when I go on my personal YouTube, it's never at the top.

17:25.200 --> 17:29.200
But if I scroll down a little bit, there's like what's going on in Canada section

17:30.120 --> 17:34.040
already, like, I don't know.

17:35.040 --> 17:40.840
I know that that was one of the solutions that Google had proposed was like a non algorithmic

17:40.840 --> 17:45.360
solution, where they occupy a certain amount of screen space.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.560
Yeah, like that happens to my personal account for sure.

17:47.760 --> 17:54.920
It is almost always like government news, like, like Trudeau's face is all over it,

17:55.120 --> 17:57.280
like over half the content, I swear.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.960
I don't I don't get like random Canadian, Canadian, Canadian.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.480
Hmm, less Canadian, but OK, guy.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.480
I mean, this is probably just because I'm signed in as me.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.640
So it's just all our accounts because I don't really watch a lot of YouTube.

18:13.360 --> 18:13.840
All right.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.880
Well, well, I'm going to try an incognito tab then.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.960
Not that that's necessarily going to make much difference, but yeah, I've got someone

18:22.960 --> 18:25.560
to flow playing chat saying they get the same thing in the UK.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.000
So this is definitely a thing.

18:27.320 --> 18:31.160
Yeah, it might not be all users might only be users that interact with it.

18:31.560 --> 18:36.800
When shown, like I don't exactly know how it works, but this is a system that they

18:36.800 --> 18:38.320
already have to a certain degree.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.080
Interesting.

18:39.080 --> 18:41.080
Yeah, no, I don't see anything here.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.480
Maybe it's just because I'm not signed in at all.

18:44.520 --> 18:48.040
Yeah, if you know, if you're not like this, this one is signed into like the WAN

18:48.040 --> 18:51.400
show email thing that we set up and I don't have it at all here.

18:51.600 --> 18:55.240
I just have it on and I don't know that I've seen it on my work account.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.040
I just know that I've seen on my personal account.

18:57.880 --> 18:58.880
So I'm not sure.

18:58.920 --> 18:59.400
I'm not sure.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.720
Yeah, there's a few other people saying that they get the same thing.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.280
Someone's saying that they get the same thing in the US even.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.160
So this is this is definitely a thing.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.760
I don't know that everyone gets it.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.600
Yeah, someone's same in Chicago, same as the US.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.600
Another person saying they've never seen it in the US.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.880
I don't know who all has access to it, but this is definitely something that

19:16.880 --> 19:17.800
they've experimented with.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.200
And that's enough in my opinion.

19:20.400 --> 19:25.160
Like it would be cool if they mixed in content creators from that area instead

19:25.160 --> 19:26.760
of just like government news.

19:26.960 --> 19:30.320
Yeah, because that's like right now it's just like Trudeau seven times and

19:30.320 --> 19:32.360
then you can scroll to the right to see if there's more.

19:32.520 --> 19:35.080
But it would be cool if it was like, yeah, maybe one or two, like what's

19:35.080 --> 19:35.960
happening in my country.

19:35.960 --> 19:36.760
I'm not against that.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.800
But then some other content creators spattered in would be kind of neat.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.080
Yeah, I think a local tab.

19:43.320 --> 19:47.400
Yeah, would be sweet, would be a positive thing for the platform.

19:47.400 --> 19:51.520
Honestly, like we the fact that local news is basically dead at this point

19:51.520 --> 19:56.680
between the decline of newspapers and the consolidation of local TV stations.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.880
It makes it kind of hard to figure out what the heck's going on.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.120
Yeah, that's a bad thing.

20:00.120 --> 20:03.640
I mean, so what I I've just rely entirely on R slash Vancouver.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah, like that sucks.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.160
Is that I'm not going to join a Facebook group.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.080
That that is that is an option.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.480
It might be like Yvonne's in like the, you know, the neighborhood, the

20:12.480 --> 20:14.840
neighborhood, the neighborhood Facebook group.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.040
And just like, I okay.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.960
On the one hand, I'm saying, look, more local content, definitely good thing.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.560
On the other hand, I don't need to know that there's a raccoon in your yard.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.520
Like the level of granularity.

20:25.520 --> 20:30.760
Yeah, I just, I wish there was a bit of vetting before it hits my eyeballs.

20:30.840 --> 20:31.200
Yeah.

20:31.400 --> 20:31.560
Yeah.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.320
Does anyone else possibly be interested in this?

20:33.400 --> 20:33.760
No.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.080
Okay.

20:34.080 --> 20:34.680
Maybe not then.

20:38.040 --> 20:38.280
Yeah.

20:38.280 --> 20:43.640
So like having options like that is cool, but changing the general algorithm.

20:43.680 --> 20:44.920
Like, no, I don't want that.

20:45.240 --> 20:50.840
What if I am specifically into, uh, scientific Japanese culture?

20:50.880 --> 20:51.360
Sure.

20:51.880 --> 20:52.200
Yeah.

20:52.200 --> 20:52.600
Something.

20:52.600 --> 20:57.200
I don't need videos on Japanese culture only from like Canadian creators.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.160
Yeah, probably not.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.080
Why would I care if that's what I was coming here for?

21:00.080 --> 21:05.120
So I guess you have already really given me your, your, your thoughts then on our

21:05.120 --> 21:08.720
second discussion question, which is how do you feel about CanCon in general?

21:09.040 --> 21:14.360
Do you think Canada should attempt to protect its culture from the evil Americans?

21:14.760 --> 21:20.240
And I put that in finger quotes because in Canada, there is a pretty big

21:20.240 --> 21:25.160
perception that, um, culturally, we're, we're pretty much just like, um,

21:25.280 --> 21:27.080
Melting Pot America's hat.

21:27.200 --> 21:27.360
Yeah.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.400
We don't really have our own.

21:28.400 --> 21:28.680
Yeah.

21:28.680 --> 21:33.800
We, we have a lot of, you know, cultural imports and very few cultural exports.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.480
Like it's mostly, it's mostly things that people meme on.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.920
It's like, oh, Tim Hortons was ruined.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.760
Maple syrup.

21:38.960 --> 21:39.320
Yeah.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.560
And hockey.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.080
Yeah.

21:41.480 --> 21:42.760
You know, those are pretty good.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.240
Look, we got our pretty solid curling.

21:46.280 --> 21:46.760
All right.

21:47.040 --> 21:47.360
Yeah.

21:47.360 --> 21:50.040
It's not like, it's not like we're complaining about the things

21:50.040 --> 21:51.880
that are, that are uniquely Canadian.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.840
But we are largely a culture importer for sure.

21:53.880 --> 21:58.200
But a lot of the, a lot of our like actors, actresses, musicians,

21:58.200 --> 22:02.040
stuff like that end up going down to the States and being perceived as American

22:02.040 --> 22:02.560
creators.

22:02.920 --> 22:09.000
Um, and, and yeah, like if I, I would like, uh, like you said, a local tab or

22:09.000 --> 22:13.160
like below my main boxes, like a bar that has local content, that'd be cool.

22:13.160 --> 22:13.600
But that's it.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.400
I don't want any more than that.

22:14.520 --> 22:17.320
And like, uh, you know, if you want to talk about, you know, influences

22:17.320 --> 22:21.240
during your formative years, I guarantee you a lot more young kids in

22:21.240 --> 22:24.600
Canada watched friends than Kim's convenience, right?

22:24.600 --> 22:26.320
Like it's Kim's convenience is great though.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.160
Sure.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.120
But like I found it wasn't hard for me to find.

22:30.400 --> 22:33.880
I didn't go looking for, I'm sure it wasn't influenced by this

22:33.880 --> 22:35.000
because this didn't exist yet.

22:35.120 --> 22:39.600
I think a big problem for me too is what exactly constitutes Canadian content

22:39.600 --> 22:45.960
because even if we ignore the heavy cultural imports, um, like you alluded

22:45.960 --> 22:50.280
to already Canada, such a mixing pot, at least in the urban centers, which is

22:50.280 --> 22:56.600
the vast majority of the population here, that Canadian content could be

22:56.600 --> 22:59.440
basically anything because it's defined by your citizenship.

22:59.440 --> 23:03.760
So if you have a Canadian citizenship, then okay, it's Canadian content now,

23:03.760 --> 23:05.480
but it's like, well, what do you, well, what even is that?

23:05.480 --> 23:05.880
I don't know.

23:06.280 --> 23:06.480
Yeah.

23:06.480 --> 23:07.680
Um, I don't know.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.800
It's, it's a funny thing.

23:08.800 --> 23:13.520
The whole, the whole sort of cultural pride thing is something that I observe

23:13.840 --> 23:19.200
in foreigners a lot, um, but not something that I can really relate to.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.120
Um, you know, okay.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.880
On the subject of our, of our friend, John, who still works for us.

23:23.920 --> 23:24.320
Yes.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.360
Um, but he's based down in, in one of the Carolinas.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.160
I know, I know which one I'm just not saying which one.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.080
I have no idea how.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.320
Don't need to narrow it down more than that.

23:32.360 --> 23:32.560
Yeah.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.080
I don't need to narrow it down more than that.

23:34.080 --> 23:34.520
Over there.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.120
I think he's pretty public about where he lives, but I, I don't feel like checking

23:38.120 --> 23:38.440
right now.

23:38.440 --> 23:38.920
It's fine.

23:38.920 --> 23:42.000
Anyway, the point is he's over on, on, on the East, in the East, in the US.

23:42.440 --> 23:47.080
Um, and like, you know, for him, it's a, it's a, it's often a source of like great

23:47.080 --> 23:51.840
pride that a particular hot sauce or whatever was, uh, was teams.

23:52.200 --> 23:52.560
Yeah.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.520
Sports teams.

23:53.720 --> 23:58.400
I mean, sports teams, I want to sort of get to that later because sports teams, I

23:58.400 --> 24:01.160
think, are sort of universal East in North America.

24:01.160 --> 24:05.440
I think people form relationships with regional sports teams, but for me, the

24:05.440 --> 24:11.200
big one was, you know, monuments or, or people that came from the same school.

24:11.200 --> 24:15.760
Like he would feel a sense of personal pride or a sense of personal shame when

24:15.760 --> 24:20.320
people from his, from his post-secondary institution went on to do great things or

24:20.320 --> 24:21.360
very terrible things.

24:21.680 --> 24:22.000
Right.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.240
And that's something that I don't know.

24:25.240 --> 24:29.280
Maybe it's because I don't really know anything about my own heritage that I've

24:29.280 --> 24:31.600
just never been able to relate to.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.640
I don't, I don't get it.

24:32.640 --> 24:37.280
We did a really intensely bad job of this before this bill and this bill is not

24:37.280 --> 24:37.920
going to help.

24:38.880 --> 24:42.480
Like if you were trying to foster Canadian heritage, this is not the way to do it.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.520
And I mean, honestly, I don't think anyone thinks it will.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.200
Not really.

24:46.640 --> 24:51.440
As far as I could tell, you know, the justifications that were provided to

24:51.440 --> 24:58.960
me, uh, and, and they, they were extremely, uh, you know, well articulated, but if

24:58.960 --> 25:04.720
you got even past the very, very, very skimming top skin of the surface, didn't

25:04.720 --> 25:05.600
make any sense.

25:05.840 --> 25:10.000
It's like, well, you know, how are we going to make sure that Canadian stories get

25:10.000 --> 25:13.040
told and I'm sitting here going, well, I don't know.

25:13.040 --> 25:17.200
You could tell Canadians to pick up a cell phone and tell their story.

25:18.320 --> 25:23.360
And if anyone wants to hear it, if it's an interesting story, then you know what's

25:23.360 --> 25:27.200
great about the internet, the way that it is right now without you mucking around

25:27.200 --> 25:33.520
with it is that they can tell that story and anyone, be they Canadian or American or

25:34.080 --> 25:40.080
or letter Kenny and Texan are both intensely Canadian.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.920
By the way, I know, I know, I know you guys haven't succeeded yet.

25:45.920 --> 25:46.480
Low star.

25:48.800 --> 25:53.280
Letter Kenny and Shorzi are both intensely Canadian pieces of content.

25:53.280 --> 25:53.680
Yeah.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.800
Amazingly good.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.160
The language and stuff gets pretty intense.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.440
I could be talking to kids.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.200
I wouldn't necessarily recommend that you watch it.

26:03.200 --> 26:07.680
If you're an adult, though, it's fantastic content and it's popular outside of Canada

26:07.680 --> 26:11.680
and it like really displays a lot of like intensely Canadian culture.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.480
So that's, it's great.

26:14.480 --> 26:18.080
It's made very well and it went very far and is still continuing to go very far with Shorzi.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.200
It's possible.

26:21.200 --> 26:21.840
We do it.

26:21.840 --> 26:22.400
Things happen.

26:22.960 --> 26:23.360
Yeah.

26:23.360 --> 26:29.840
And I mean, I guess for me, you know, part of my cynicism comes from how difficult it was

26:29.840 --> 26:32.480
to actually get funding as a small time creator.

26:32.480 --> 26:36.800
So when the justification given to me is like, well, how do we fund uniquely Canadian stories?

26:36.800 --> 26:38.320
Like one of the examples given to me.

26:38.320 --> 26:42.240
I just want to interject because the way that you said it made it sound like it's

26:42.240 --> 26:43.520
no longer difficult.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.720
Oh yeah, it's still very difficult.

26:45.280 --> 26:45.600
Yeah.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.000
Are we still waiting for stuff from like years ago?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.440
Like 2019 or something like that.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.160
Yeah.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.320
Like pandemic was over a while ago.

26:52.320 --> 26:52.720
Yeah.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.000
Like that, that type of funding timeline.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.120
I mean, sorry, sorry, excuse me.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.960
Pandemic was over a while ago, eh?

26:59.120 --> 27:05.040
Yeah, that cultural influence from the South has taken over.

27:06.080 --> 27:06.560
New York.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.680
We're already moving.

27:09.680 --> 27:10.400
We're out the door.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.120
We'll be there in a minute, America.

27:14.080 --> 27:20.880
But those funding timelines don't work if you're not 100% funding yourself already.

27:20.880 --> 27:21.200
Yeah.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.120
So like, what a failure.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.000
Yeah.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.280
I yeah.

27:25.280 --> 27:30.400
And like, you know, the example, one of the examples that was given to me of, you know,

27:30.400 --> 27:33.280
the kind of story that could be told because I challenged that, right?

27:33.280 --> 27:34.240
I went, well, what story?

27:35.040 --> 27:36.880
What story is not told right now?

27:36.880 --> 27:40.000
I'm like, oh, well, you know, what about the story of an anglophone?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.360
That means an English speaker.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.400
An anglophone living in an all French community.

27:46.000 --> 27:46.560
Okay.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.360
What about it?

27:48.400 --> 27:49.520
So tell that story.

27:49.520 --> 27:53.920
And then when nobody fucking cares, then we can all move on with our day.

27:54.880 --> 27:59.040
And then if you have some way of making it funny or very well written or something,

27:59.040 --> 28:01.280
which is possible, then you'll find success.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.400
I don't do well.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.560
And maybe this is just like, what's it called?

28:04.560 --> 28:06.800
Survivorship bias or something like that?

28:07.360 --> 28:09.200
Survivorship bias.

28:09.200 --> 28:09.680
Here we go.

28:09.680 --> 28:10.080
Here we go.

28:10.080 --> 28:13.680
Survivorship bias is a type of sample selection bias that occurs when an individual

28:13.680 --> 28:17.120
mistakes a visible successful subgroup as the entire group.

28:17.120 --> 28:23.200
So sure, I definitely experienced survivorship bias because I did

28:23.200 --> 28:28.880
make it through the gauntlet of breaking out on social media.

28:28.880 --> 28:29.360
Right.

28:29.360 --> 28:36.400
And so I'm looking at it going, well, if you keep pounding your fists at that wall

28:36.400 --> 28:38.880
long enough, eventually you'll, you could break it down.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.600
And, but maybe that's not true.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.720
And maybe that's not fair.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.120
And maybe that story does need to be told.

28:45.120 --> 28:48.640
But then my question, you know, so my rebuttal to that is,

28:48.800 --> 28:56.000
is it really being told if you create the content so you throw money at this thing

28:56.000 --> 28:58.160
and then 46 people watch it?

28:58.160 --> 28:58.560
Yeah.

28:58.560 --> 29:02.240
Cause like it'll show up in people's algorithms, but how these platforms work.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.080
You don't have to watch that thing.

29:04.080 --> 29:04.560
Yes.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.720
You would have to click on it to watch it.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.000
So it's just not going to get clicked on.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
So they're treating this like TV where the audience is captive to a degree,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.200
but that's not the case.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.520
You still don't have to click on things.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.880
And it comes down to that age old philosophical debate.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.920
If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, does it make a sound?

29:21.920 --> 29:21.920


29:21.920 --> 29:28.880
I would make the argument that a story told in an empty room in the dark has not been told.

29:28.880 --> 29:36.000
It's just been conceived of, you know, like it's not, is it a story if it's not passed

29:36.000 --> 29:36.720
along to anybody?

29:36.720 --> 29:40.240
The empty room in the dark thing doesn't really work, but I do agree with the,

29:40.240 --> 29:42.720
you can definitely tell stories.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.400
You can definitely tell stories.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.880
I was just trying to, I was trying to paint a lonely picture.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.520
There's no microphone.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.520
It's not a sleepover.

29:53.520 --> 29:54.800
The room is empty.

29:55.920 --> 29:56.560
It's dark.

29:56.560 --> 29:57.600
There's no lights even.

29:58.160 --> 29:58.480
Okay.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.360
Because the energy could be converted to matter.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.480
It's fully empty.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.600
Yeah, I don't know.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.560
I don't see necessarily a lot of, or any value to that.

30:13.280 --> 30:16.480
We know how brutal it is to try to get clicked on.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.960
I'm not against funding Canadian content.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.840
I just don't want it funded because it's Canadian content.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.000
I want it funded because it's good.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.920
Like it's the same way, like, man, I see a lot of people challenge me because,

30:31.920 --> 30:37.680
generally speaking, I am pro societal good.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.840
I don't mind paying my taxes, right?

30:40.800 --> 30:43.040
And people will challenge me on that and go,

30:43.040 --> 30:44.720
well, yeah, but what about government waste?

30:45.360 --> 30:46.160
What about it?

30:46.800 --> 30:48.160
Yeah, it fucking sucks.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.080
Not into it.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.120
Even a little.

30:51.120 --> 30:54.800
Like I spend my life trying to make things efficient around me.

30:54.800 --> 31:01.840
And the fact that an entire sort of subclass of citizens exists

31:01.840 --> 31:05.520
to utilize my money in a way that's not efficient

31:06.240 --> 31:07.760
is it's bullshit, right?

31:07.760 --> 31:08.480
Obviously.

31:10.160 --> 31:16.800
But the flip side of that is that I also do run a company now that is small or medium,

31:16.800 --> 31:18.480
depending on how you measure it.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.120
And I understand that when you scale past a certain point,

31:21.680 --> 31:23.520
bureaucracy is unavoidable.

31:24.160 --> 31:26.560
Waste is just a fact of life.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.200
And so I don't know.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.960
I'm split because I do need roads to drive on.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.040
I do need hospitals to visit.

31:35.040 --> 31:39.200
I do need an education system for my kids to participate in, right?

31:39.200 --> 31:44.240
Like there are there are actual greater good benefits that taxes do allow for.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.960
But yeah, that doesn't mean that I'm not mad when it gets wasted.

31:48.960 --> 31:52.720
And this is one of those cases where I look at it and I go, all right,

31:52.720 --> 31:54.880
well, I mean, you like had this money.

31:54.880 --> 32:01.600
And as far as I can tell, a lot of it gets wasted either on like as a as a subsidy for foreign

32:01.600 --> 32:05.440
companies, you know, like it doesn't it doesn't make sense to me how much animation

32:05.440 --> 32:07.440
takes place in Canada, for example.

32:07.440 --> 32:11.360
And how few Canadian media companies there are.

32:13.360 --> 32:14.320
Yeah.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.120
What?

32:15.120 --> 32:15.600
Why?

32:15.600 --> 32:18.720
Why are they why are they all just working for American companies?

32:18.720 --> 32:22.880
So it seems to me that there are systemic problems that need to be solved before you just

32:22.880 --> 32:29.040
go grab more cash from online streaming platforms and then sort of vaguely have some idea of how

32:29.040 --> 32:32.080
you're going to use it to something, something Canadian story, something.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.960
I don't know, man.

32:40.720 --> 32:41.600
Frustrated.

32:41.600 --> 32:42.400
Yes.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.520
Yeah, frustrated.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.880
Frustrated enough to actually, you know, pick up and leave.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.800
Honestly, no.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.200
Like it's so incredibly difficult at this point.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.160
So there's that.

32:52.160 --> 32:57.440
And, you know, honestly speaking, how does how does the old biblical thing go?

32:58.240 --> 33:02.960
Uh, we're worried not about the splinter in your neighbor's eye until you've removed the

33:02.960 --> 33:05.680
two by four from your own or something like that.

33:05.680 --> 33:13.200
Like if if if as an American, you are outraged by how ridiculous the C11 thing looks,

33:17.360 --> 33:20.080
you know, it's not perfect anywhere.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.120
There's always stuff going on.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.640
Is what I'm kind of trying to say.

33:22.640 --> 33:29.920
And overall, the perception that a lot of consumers of American, particularly American

33:29.920 --> 33:36.880
media seem to have of Canada is just simply not correct, not even close.

33:37.520 --> 33:43.920
Like there's, there's, I often see comments about, you know, what life must be like in the

33:43.920 --> 33:46.240
Canadian, you know, societal hellhole.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.800
And it's, it's a particular.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.440
I think this is true about like basically everywhere though.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.800
No, not really.

33:52.800 --> 33:57.040
I don't see it from a lot of Europeans and it's not that they're not talking to me.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.160
Like I, I, I read.

34:00.160 --> 34:00.880
Oh, I see.

34:00.880 --> 34:01.120
Okay.

34:01.120 --> 34:07.360
No, what I, what I meant is that like if you, if you watch media or like news from a certain

34:07.360 --> 34:11.200
country that when you show up, it's different than what you might have expected.

34:11.200 --> 34:16.160
No, it's just that there are, there are some types of American media and there's some consumers

34:16.160 --> 34:20.400
of American media, certain types of American media that seem to be under the impression that

34:20.400 --> 34:23.040
Canada is some kind of dystopian hellscape.

34:24.240 --> 34:24.960
It's pretty chill.

34:24.960 --> 34:25.440
And it's,

34:25.440 --> 34:28.240
There's things I could complain about for days, but

34:28.240 --> 34:29.040
Absolutely.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.480
It's pretty chill overall.

34:30.480 --> 34:30.720
Yeah.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.480
A lot of questions here.

34:34.480 --> 34:38.720
I mean, we've got Dangered Wolf asking, would you consider creating an American branch of LMG,

34:38.720 --> 34:40.480
even if LMG remains based in Canada?

34:41.520 --> 34:42.480
Why would I do that?

34:43.520 --> 34:49.600
Now I get to deal with the broken ass American tax system on top of the broken ass Canadian tax

34:49.600 --> 34:49.920
system.

34:49.920 --> 34:50.800
Super fun.

34:50.800 --> 34:51.840
Incredibly fun.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.800
How about no, sorry, sorry.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.320
In Canada, we don't have guns.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.720
So I need, how about no?

35:03.520 --> 35:06.560
By the way, we do have a lot of guns.

35:08.640 --> 35:13.200
I don't personally actually, but Colton does, which is why we've never actually fired him.

35:13.440 --> 35:22.880
There was, there was quite a few years ago, there was a point in time where the like firearms

35:22.880 --> 35:26.160
per capita in Canada was like very, very high.

35:26.160 --> 35:31.520
But it was a lot of, yeah, I'm not even going to get into it, but yeah, we have.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.800
Well, plain chat, finger knife.

35:35.760 --> 35:36.240
I'll get you.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.400
Hey, from within, what is it?

35:38.400 --> 35:40.240
Six feet, eight feet or something like that?

35:40.240 --> 35:42.080
Knife's more lethal than a gun.

35:42.160 --> 35:46.960
Whatever that conventional wisdom is.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.560
Why don't we roll into our next topic?

35:48.560 --> 35:54.160
AMD is rolling out a fix for burnt Ryzen X3D CPUs.

35:54.960 --> 35:58.080
Let's go ahead and pop this up here.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.360
This is originally covered by Extreme Tech, I think.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.320
Well, maybe not originally, but they're one of the sources we've got.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.840
Oh, an on-tech has covered this as well.

36:06.640 --> 36:07.120
All right.

36:07.120 --> 36:07.840
So here you go.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.840
This is a good look at the picture here.

36:10.720 --> 36:11.440
Whew.

36:11.440 --> 36:11.920
Yikes.

36:12.720 --> 36:17.120
That's a, that's a spicy CPU socket right here.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.600
AMD released an official statement.

36:19.600 --> 36:20.320
Thanks, Gavin.

36:20.960 --> 36:24.160
We have root caused the issue and have already distributed a new

36:24.160 --> 36:28.560
aegisa that puts measures in place on certain power rails on AM5 motherboards to

36:28.560 --> 36:31.360
prevent the CPU from operating beyond its specification limits,

36:31.360 --> 36:35.200
including a cap on SoC voltage at 1.3 volts.

36:35.200 --> 36:39.120
This doesn't affect their ability to overclock memory using Xperia XMP kits

36:39.120 --> 36:41.520
or boost performance using PBO technology.

36:42.400 --> 36:46.240
They are expecting this fix to roll out through all of their board partners.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.640
And blah, blah, blah.

36:48.640 --> 36:52.880
Apparently ASUS and MSI had already implemented their own fixes prior to AMD

36:52.880 --> 36:56.720
and had suggested that excessive voltages in expo memory profiles

36:56.720 --> 36:59.120
had allowed the SoC voltage to reach unsafe levels.

37:02.160 --> 37:05.600
They did not clarify if there were any other issues that they found

37:05.600 --> 37:08.640
or whether non X3D processors were also at risk.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.600
But I would be, I would be kind of surprised if they were.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.400
They've been out there for quite a lot longer at this point

37:15.040 --> 37:18.160
and they draw quite a lot more power.

37:18.160 --> 37:24.480
So if you're, if you're running at the same voltages or higher in some cases

37:24.480 --> 37:28.160
and you're drawing more current, I really don't see

37:29.920 --> 37:32.320
how we wouldn't have noticed this at some point.

37:35.680 --> 37:39.120
Steve from Gamers Nexus has apparently acquired Speed Rookie.

37:39.120 --> 37:42.080
That's the, that's the username of the owner of that CPU.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.760
Speed Rookie CPU and motherboard.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.240
So maybe there'll be some kind of further insight,

37:46.240 --> 37:50.320
but if AMD's got this nailed down and they're not just issuing a denial,

37:51.280 --> 37:54.880
then it seems like it's probably, probably solved at this point.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.440
I mean, that definitely looks like power got out of hand.

37:58.160 --> 37:58.400
Yeah.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.560
I mean, I'm not, I'm not an electronics engineer.

38:03.280 --> 38:10.000
So, um, Dan's holding his phone like this, which is a, oh, oh, oh, car key.

38:10.000 --> 38:10.400
I see.

38:10.960 --> 38:11.600
Hello, wife.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.720
Do you want to say hi to the WAN show?

38:14.240 --> 38:14.880
She shrugged.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.160
I think that means yes.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.560
At least that's how I interpret it late at night, if you know what I mean.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.480
I mean, what?

38:22.480 --> 38:23.040
What shrugged?

38:24.080 --> 38:24.880
Kind of a scent.

38:26.560 --> 38:26.960
Anywho.

38:26.960 --> 38:32.560
Bye.

38:34.000 --> 38:34.400
See ya.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.760
Riley is adding a discussion question right now.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.080
Lili, Riley, Lili, Riley, go home.

38:40.080 --> 38:40.960
Work, work days over.

38:41.600 --> 38:45.440
But asks, has more hardware been failing recently than used to be the norm?

38:46.000 --> 38:49.280
Or is this kind of thing more normal than it seems to me?

38:49.920 --> 38:52.640
I mean, CPUs failing?

38:52.640 --> 38:54.960
Yeah, that's, that's pretty abnormal.

38:54.960 --> 38:55.520
Yeah.

38:55.520 --> 38:56.160
Yeah.

38:56.160 --> 39:00.960
Hardware in general, I would say probably no, to be honest, but CPUs, yes.

39:00.960 --> 39:01.200
Yeah.

39:01.200 --> 39:06.160
If anything, I would say the designs for motherboards these days are far more robust

39:06.160 --> 39:10.560
than what we used to have in the past with like electrolytic capacitors and stuff like that.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.120
Like the caps were, that was fun.

39:13.120 --> 39:18.800
At least for enthusiasts, the emphasis that gets placed on cooling these days by manufacturers,

39:19.440 --> 39:22.480
I think that while they're certainly pumping more power through these things,

39:22.480 --> 39:23.600
there's a lot more heat output.

39:24.400 --> 39:30.400
There's a lot more attentiveness to keeping things cool and maintaining the longevity

39:30.400 --> 39:31.120
of these devices.

39:31.760 --> 39:38.080
As a whole, the industry has learned a lot about the doodads and gizmos that they're playing around

39:38.080 --> 39:38.960
with, right?

39:38.960 --> 39:45.040
And if you're a manufacturer, you do not want a failure, at least not within the one to three

39:45.040 --> 39:47.760
years that most of them offer a warranty on their products.

39:48.400 --> 39:52.480
So, I mean, with that said, I'm not saying that mistakes never get made.

39:52.480 --> 39:56.720
I mean, you ask someone like a Louis Rossman about MacBooks and he'll tell you all about

39:56.720 --> 39:58.560
design flaws for days or whatever.

39:58.560 --> 40:06.960
But overall, I can't say that I've, I can't say that it seems any worse to me.

40:08.960 --> 40:09.360
Yeah.

40:09.360 --> 40:14.720
Like we said, kind of at the beginning, probably not worse overall, but it is surprising for

40:14.720 --> 40:15.680
it to hit CPUs.

40:15.680 --> 40:19.360
CPUs have always kind of been the rock solid piece of hardware in your computer.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
Go through multiple boards for one extremely long-term CPU sometimes.

40:25.040 --> 40:25.520
Yeah.

40:26.240 --> 40:26.720
Yeah.

40:26.720 --> 40:32.640
And I feel like woefully unreliable stuff was way more common back then.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.520
Like, think about the early 680i motherboards.

40:36.160 --> 40:36.960
Remember those?

40:37.440 --> 40:38.400
They were awful.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.600
They failed all over the place.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.560
Everybody knew it.

40:40.560 --> 40:45.360
I haven't seen just a known bad.

40:45.920 --> 40:49.520
Part like that in a long time.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.080
Yeah.

40:50.080 --> 40:54.320
I feel like we might have, we might have had like a few years there where it was abnormally

40:54.320 --> 40:58.640
low and we might be coming back out of that and that might be why he's feeling it more.

40:59.360 --> 41:03.600
But it was definitely like, yeah, it was definitely pretty freaking bad.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.080
Yeah.

41:04.080 --> 41:04.640
Floatplane chat.

41:04.640 --> 41:05.600
Shout out OCC.

41:06.480 --> 41:06.800
Yeah.

41:06.800 --> 41:10.960
I mean, their memory modules would just drop dead spontaneously because

41:11.760 --> 41:15.680
Ram used to, like one of the first things I would check with diagnosing computers was,

41:15.680 --> 41:17.120
does it have liquid caps?

41:17.120 --> 41:19.680
And if there's a problem, does it have liquid caps?

41:19.680 --> 41:20.240
No.

41:20.240 --> 41:20.720
Okay.

41:20.720 --> 41:21.440
Is the ram dead?

41:21.440 --> 41:21.920
Like.

41:21.920 --> 41:29.120
And OCC would literally create kits of what was called UTT memory, okay, which is short

41:29.120 --> 41:36.880
for untested, they would, they would have these UTT memory kits, they would sell them at like

41:37.520 --> 41:42.480
these insane speeds and really low latencies and high voltages.

41:42.480 --> 41:47.360
And I think they were just playing a numbers game where they, they bought this like cheap

41:47.360 --> 41:54.240
bargain memory, basically went, yeah, if anything goes wrong with it, lifetime warranty, we got

41:54.240 --> 41:54.800
you.

41:54.800 --> 41:59.600
And then they just counted on few enough of the buyers actually running those volts through

41:59.600 --> 42:00.240
them.

42:00.240 --> 42:03.760
And in the event that they did, few enough of them bothering.

42:04.080 --> 42:08.160
Because you know what, realistically, what, do I really even want a replacement for this?

42:08.160 --> 42:13.040
Or because the technology industry was moving so fast, would I rather just upgrade to something

42:13.040 --> 42:13.840
else at this point?

42:13.840 --> 42:15.760
Anyway, you know what, forget it.

42:15.760 --> 42:19.360
I think, I think that was the entire basis of their company.

42:21.760 --> 42:24.480
Yeah, I mean, agility SSDs, anyone?

42:24.480 --> 42:30.880
Oh, you know, what's funny is some of, yeah, that, that might be, that might be a little

42:30.960 --> 42:37.040
is some of, yeah, that model where they just buy all this like trash, sometimes some of

42:37.040 --> 42:38.240
it works for a really long time.

42:38.240 --> 42:42.960
I was going to say, so I was actually the product manager for OCC at NCIX for a short

42:42.960 --> 42:43.600
period of time.

42:44.240 --> 42:50.400
And their RAM was fine in those days, other than the very high spec stuff, other than the

42:50.400 --> 42:55.040
very high spec DDR2, but that could have easily been down to the memory controllers just not

42:55.040 --> 42:58.240
being able to handle it because it was early days of DDR2.

42:58.240 --> 42:59.440
And it was rough.

43:00.400 --> 43:05.920
I don't think we've had a worse transition than the one from DDR1 to DDR2, at least not

43:05.920 --> 43:08.080
since then anyway, DDR3 is kind of rough.

43:08.080 --> 43:13.360
Anyway, the point is their RAM was actually mostly pretty good in those days.

43:13.360 --> 43:17.680
And depending on the batch, the SSDs were actually super reliable.

43:17.680 --> 43:22.640
We had this, we back in the day, yeah, this green OCC Agility 3.

43:22.640 --> 43:24.480
I just looked it up to make sure that I was right.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.840
And that thing went through probably years and years.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.640
A ton of junk over a lot of years.

43:30.640 --> 43:33.200
Except when they had bad batches.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.480
Yeah, this is what I'm saying.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.840
Because that's the thing.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.040
It was a scamble.

43:37.040 --> 43:38.640
Is it?

43:38.640 --> 43:42.000
Bad QC is not always a problem.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.120
It doesn't mean bad product.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.560
It's only a problem when you don't catch something.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.360
Yeah, yeah.

43:47.360 --> 43:47.680
Right?

43:48.640 --> 43:54.320
So this is why, okay, so we used to do these factory tours and we would often get pushback

43:54.320 --> 43:56.160
when we would try to show their failures.

43:57.280 --> 43:59.280
Because they would have like, oh, a failure bin or whatever,

43:59.280 --> 44:00.640
where like something didn't work out.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.960
Yeah, Sennheiser was super mad.

44:02.960 --> 44:07.920
They didn't want us to show it was failed drivers for the HD 800.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.400
Yeah, and we were like, no, this is a good story

44:10.400 --> 44:13.280
because this shows you're not going to ship them.

44:13.280 --> 44:14.080
Yes.

44:14.080 --> 44:17.280
Oh man, we had to twist their arms so hard.

44:18.560 --> 44:22.000
I don't like profiling, but Germans, okay?

44:22.960 --> 44:24.160
German perfection.

44:25.040 --> 44:29.680
There's a sense of, again, this is something I just like, I can't relate to, right?

44:29.680 --> 44:35.360
But there's this like cultural sense of pride in German craftsmanship, right?

44:36.800 --> 44:39.360
So they didn't want to show that there could be a flaw.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.800
And I'm sitting here going, no, no, no.

44:42.800 --> 44:51.200
No, this is a story about painstakingly thorough German quality control.

44:51.680 --> 44:56.720
It doesn't have to be a story about make it right the first time, every time.

44:56.720 --> 45:00.880
Yeah, like we were trying to show that it was cool that this happened.

45:00.880 --> 45:04.320
We weren't trying to dog on them, but it took, it took some convincing.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.240
I think eventually, yeah.

45:06.240 --> 45:08.560
We did end up including that in the video.

45:08.560 --> 45:12.640
And I felt that that was a truly really important part of the story.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.440
Agreed.

45:13.440 --> 45:14.960
Because they really did care a lot.

45:14.960 --> 45:20.000
They actually, and I mean, I did that video testing out cheap sports tech a little while ago.

45:21.360 --> 45:25.520
If you don't match the frequency response of the drivers in each year,

45:26.160 --> 45:29.360
it's a noticeable problem in the listening experience.

45:29.360 --> 45:33.040
And but that's what they were doing was they were finding ones that didn't meet their standard

45:33.040 --> 45:36.560
and they were making sure that the drivers were appropriately matched.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.320
Really great story.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:39.360 --> 45:41.840
Ben, that was a hilarious factory.

45:41.840 --> 45:47.600
Seeing the German versus the Japanese approach, like almost back to back, right?

45:47.600 --> 45:50.960
There was only a few months in between was really eye-opening.

45:50.960 --> 45:52.640
Because we went to Armouron afterwards.

45:52.640 --> 46:01.200
Yeah, both sort of both countries and cultures are well respected around the world for exactly that.

46:03.120 --> 46:10.800
But they come to this conclusion, the same conclusion, in such utterly different ways,

46:10.800 --> 46:11.600
right?

46:11.600 --> 46:17.360
So, I mean, I forget if it was, was it Sennheiser or Cherry?

46:17.360 --> 46:18.560
I think it might have been Sennheiser.

46:18.560 --> 46:19.920
These were both in Germany.

46:19.920 --> 46:22.400
But they had these bulletin boards.

46:22.400 --> 46:25.920
And I will remember this forever till the day I die.

46:25.920 --> 46:30.720
First of all, both of them spotless, so clean you could eat off of any surface.

46:30.720 --> 46:31.440
This was Sennheiser.

46:31.440 --> 46:32.000
I remember this too.

46:32.000 --> 46:32.960
This was wild.

46:32.960 --> 46:33.280
Yeah.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.880
Okay, spotless.

46:34.880 --> 46:37.200
Like it didn't look like a factory.

46:37.200 --> 46:38.240
It didn't smell like a factory.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.440
They were definitely making stuff.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.560
You could eat off the floor.

46:40.560 --> 46:43.120
You could eat off any surface, I swear to you.

46:44.080 --> 46:48.240
Anyway, they had these bulletin boards spaced out very evenly.

46:48.480 --> 46:55.360
And they had things like safety bulletins, schedules, upcoming events,

46:55.360 --> 46:58.880
workplace safety notices, all that kind of thing.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.680
And then in one corner, I think it was the corner.

47:01.680 --> 47:04.880
They had just this arrangement of rectangles.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.040
And I stopped.

47:07.040 --> 47:13.680
I stopped the tour and I said, is that to make sure that the way that all the other

47:13.680 --> 47:17.040
bulletins are posted is exactly the same on everyone.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.360
And they're like, yeah.

47:19.360 --> 47:19.600
Yes.

47:24.800 --> 47:30.960
And so interviewing people there and talking to them, not just the business people,

47:30.960 --> 47:32.960
we got to talk to engineers as well.

47:32.960 --> 47:35.440
There's a different philosophy.

47:36.560 --> 47:39.360
And it was really interesting looking at both cherry and omron,

47:39.360 --> 47:43.200
because they both make fundamentally the same thing, right?

47:43.200 --> 47:48.720
So at Cherry, there was, oh, did we talk about how we were also at ZF?

47:49.680 --> 47:51.120
I don't know if we did in the video.

47:51.120 --> 47:52.080
Statue of limitations.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.520
I'm sure they're not going to get mad about it at this point.

47:53.520 --> 47:56.480
Anyway, the point is we also got to check out some ZF stuff,

47:56.480 --> 47:58.080
even if it didn't make it into the video.

47:58.080 --> 48:01.120
So ZF does a lot of work for the automotive industry,

48:01.120 --> 48:02.800
which is kind of a thing in Germany, right?

48:04.560 --> 48:10.880
And anyway, but it's the Cherry MX switch versus it was the Romer G that Omron and

48:10.880 --> 48:13.840
Logitech, who actually sponsored the video, was really focused on.

48:13.840 --> 48:18.080
And after talking to everyone and seeing everything that we did,

48:19.280 --> 48:24.480
the bottom line, thing that I came away with, the two sort of different approaches

48:24.480 --> 48:31.520
to this same ultimate end goal, the two philosophies, was the German attitude was

48:31.520 --> 48:35.920
make it perfect, make it once, make it last, right?

48:36.560 --> 48:43.520
Whereas the Japanese approach was make it pretty darn good, make it pretty near perfect.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.120
And make it twice.

48:47.120 --> 48:49.600
And make it twice and make it last.

48:50.560 --> 48:54.800
So the way that the Cherry MX switch works, right, is there's a contact,

48:55.360 --> 48:56.160
but there's only one.

48:56.160 --> 48:57.520
It's a gold plated contact.

48:57.520 --> 49:04.080
And Cherry will talk your ear off for a week about how they fine-tuned the gold leaf on the thing

49:04.080 --> 49:07.520
in the size of the bump and blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever else, right?

49:08.160 --> 49:11.520
But in the Romer G, there's actually two.

49:12.320 --> 49:16.640
So if one of them fails, the other one still works and the switch operates normally.

49:16.640 --> 49:22.480
And I just thought, I thought those two approaches to the design of a reliable switch

49:22.480 --> 49:28.560
were so cool, so interesting, probably there's no cost benefit one way or the other,

49:28.560 --> 49:32.080
making it absolutely perfect every time versus making it mostly perfect.

49:32.080 --> 49:37.200
But with redundancy, but it just came down to design philosophy.

49:37.200 --> 49:38.240
And I thought that was super cool.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.000
You can see that in a lot of other products,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
a lot of other companies from those countries as well.

49:42.000 --> 49:42.880
It's very interesting.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.200
And the Omron factory also very clean.

49:45.200 --> 49:49.760
And I would eat off of most surfaces, but not quite all, you know?

49:49.760 --> 49:55.280
Like it was okay if the bulletins were not arranged exactly the same way on every single board.

49:56.400 --> 49:58.240
That was okay, you know?

49:58.480 --> 50:01.920
Yeah. Oh, this is interesting.

50:03.040 --> 50:07.760
There's apparently a new, there's leaked pricing for the ROG Ally.

50:07.760 --> 50:08.880
Okay, I'm sorry.

50:08.880 --> 50:11.200
I'm totally changing gears here real quick, Dan.

50:11.200 --> 50:12.240
I'm sorry, I will get to that.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.200
I'll get to that really quick.

50:15.200 --> 50:24.000
Another leak, the ROG Ally will apparently start at 600 bucks with AMD Z1 and 256 gig SSD.

50:24.000 --> 50:30.480
If that's true, then this, then that's just $70 higher than the same storage size Steam Deck.

50:30.480 --> 50:31.520
That's so aggressive.

50:31.520 --> 50:39.520
For how much more performance you're getting, and more importantly, for how quiet it is, that is awesome.

50:42.240 --> 50:44.480
Like awesome.

50:45.440 --> 50:50.640
The Ally is not a perfect experience to be very, very, very clear here.

50:50.640 --> 50:52.160
Wouldn't say the Steam Deck is though.

50:52.160 --> 50:56.400
No, well, no, but I'm talking about the Ally in a different way.

50:56.400 --> 50:58.080
I'm just clarifying for people.

50:58.080 --> 51:05.840
Sure. Game compatibility is much better, but the experience of playing those compatible games,

51:06.480 --> 51:09.040
well, there's some hurdles to overcome stillness.

51:09.040 --> 51:10.880
Who says a lot of work to do on the software?

51:10.880 --> 51:11.440
Interesting.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.640
And so does Microsoft.

51:12.640 --> 51:15.840
Windows is not optimized for these handheld consoles.

51:16.640 --> 51:24.080
And like, I just, just, I have this, okay, here actually, I recorded this video on my phone conveniently.

51:24.080 --> 51:26.160
I was just, I was trying to do something basic.

51:27.680 --> 51:29.120
What the heck was I trying to do?

51:29.120 --> 51:33.840
I'm honestly having a hard time remembering, but I was, oh yeah, right, I remember.

51:33.840 --> 51:41.360
I was trying to go into the stupid AMD control panel, and I was trying to alter a setting for the GPU driver.

51:42.240 --> 51:43.440
And I had a game running.

51:43.440 --> 51:44.960
I had, I was playing Stray.

51:44.960 --> 51:45.840
I finally played Stray.

51:46.800 --> 51:50.160
I had a game running, and I couldn't get it open.

51:50.960 --> 51:53.600
It just kept being Windows about it.

51:54.160 --> 51:56.240
And yeah, I can't find it right now.

51:56.240 --> 52:01.440
But I kept, you know, swiping up, and then that brings up a little bar, and then I'd swipe up again,

52:01.440 --> 52:05.600
and then I would click the Windows icon, and then it would go away.

52:05.600 --> 52:09.680
And I'd be, okay, so I'd swipe up twice again, and then I'd go into the system tray,

52:09.680 --> 52:13.440
and then I'd click the AMD control panel, and then stupid thing would go away.

52:13.440 --> 52:14.800
And I'm like, hey, this is ridiculous.

52:14.800 --> 52:17.280
I'm not even in exclusive full screen mode right now.

52:17.280 --> 52:22.240
Like it's, the Steam Deck is a console, and that's its strength.

52:22.240 --> 52:28.720
Right now, the Ally is a computer with a controller bolted to it, and that comes with problems.

52:29.280 --> 52:32.560
And there's some things that ASUS is doing, where they're trying to,

52:34.720 --> 52:37.920
where they're attempting to mitigate that, but it's a mitigation.

52:37.920 --> 52:42.800
Unless Microsoft gets involved, it's not going to be a perfect experience.

52:42.800 --> 52:45.280
Now on the Steam Deck, I'm not saying it's perfect either.

52:45.280 --> 52:47.840
But what it is, is it's seamless.

52:47.840 --> 52:53.360
For the games that it does play, I shouldn't say seamless, it's less seamy.

52:54.720 --> 52:58.400
For the games that it does play, you can expect that there's been some kind of

52:58.400 --> 53:00.720
validation process that has taken place.

53:01.760 --> 53:03.760
Someone looked at it at some point.

53:03.760 --> 53:10.080
Do you think Valve would have been interested in packaging SteamOS with the Ally?

53:11.280 --> 53:14.960
I don't know about the Ally, but my understanding is that they at some point

53:14.960 --> 53:18.560
talked to at least some of the competing handheld console makers.

53:18.560 --> 53:23.600
And they've certainly taken a fairly open approach to the operating system.

53:23.600 --> 53:26.560
It's not like, shoot, what's it called?

53:26.560 --> 53:27.760
It's escaping me now.

53:27.760 --> 53:32.320
But there's a third party, sort of basically SteamOS.

53:33.760 --> 53:38.000
SteamOS alternative for desktop.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.720
I can't, holo, holo ISO.

53:40.720 --> 53:41.760
That's the one.

53:41.760 --> 53:45.920
And it's not like Valve is clamping down on that or anything like that.

53:45.920 --> 53:49.280
They've also, I think, I mean, they committed at some point.

53:49.280 --> 53:53.120
I don't know if they've actually talked about it lately, but they said they were going to

53:53.120 --> 53:56.480
release SteamOS as just a standalone operating system at some point.

53:56.480 --> 54:00.320
So at that point, nothing would prevent a third party handheld maker from

54:00.320 --> 54:01.360
installing it and shipping it.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.280
It's free, right?

54:05.760 --> 54:11.600
But what I also heard anecdotally is that there are certain things that Valve is keeping for

54:11.600 --> 54:15.600
themselves, like the profiles that they've created where they've tuned the game to run

54:15.600 --> 54:17.280
well on the Steam Deck hardware.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.480
Anyway, that price, excited.

54:24.480 --> 54:27.360
And now is the time to explain merch messages.

54:27.920 --> 54:32.960
Okay, those of you sending super chats, this is the one time I'm going to look at them.

54:32.960 --> 54:35.920
Hey, shout out, Prono Bozo.

54:36.720 --> 54:37.520
Super cool.

54:37.520 --> 54:38.960
And thanks, Darcy.

54:39.520 --> 54:42.240
All right, so we got a couple super chats.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.120
There you go.

54:43.120 --> 54:47.280
Because the real way to interact with the show is through merch messages.

54:47.920 --> 54:53.440
If you go on LTTstore.com and you check out with, oh, actually, don't check out quite yet,

54:53.440 --> 54:56.400
because we've got a couple of cool deals to announce and some new products,

54:56.400 --> 54:58.160
some restocks, all that kind of good stuff.

54:58.160 --> 55:03.680
But if you go on LTTstore.com and check out, you'll see a little box called merch messages,

55:03.680 --> 55:07.760
and you fill that out, you check out your order, and you will get your order in the mail,

55:07.760 --> 55:12.000
which is great, which is better than just kind of digital pixels or whatever.

55:12.000 --> 55:12.800
Throwing money into the void.

55:12.800 --> 55:15.600
Yeah, throwing money at the screen, like you would on Twitch or YouTube.

55:15.600 --> 55:20.400
And you might also get a reply from Dan, your message showing up at the bottom of the screen,

55:20.400 --> 55:24.400
if you just want to say something that means something meaningful to you.

55:25.040 --> 55:30.960
Or Dan will select a handful of them for me and Luke to talk about either now or during

55:31.840 --> 55:35.120
WAN show After Dark, which is sort of the second half of the show.

55:36.800 --> 55:40.000
Now's a good time for me to go through and talk about some of the exciting stuff we've

55:40.000 --> 55:42.240
got going on on the store this week.

55:43.200 --> 55:46.400
First up is if you, wait, did Nick get that done?

55:46.400 --> 55:47.360
I don't see it in the notes.

55:50.560 --> 55:51.680
Dan, the backpack thing.

55:51.680 --> 55:52.640
The backpack thing.

55:52.640 --> 55:53.120
Do we know?

55:55.360 --> 55:57.840
Uh, oh, it should be done.

55:57.840 --> 56:06.080
Okay, we've got a pretty cool promotion to celebrate almost being ready to ship a solution

56:06.080 --> 56:08.480
to the carabiner zipper pull thing.

56:08.480 --> 56:09.840
Yes, we are still working on it.

56:09.840 --> 56:12.400
We're very, very close and we have an update to share with you guys very shortly.

56:12.400 --> 56:13.680
Luke's actually got them over there.

56:14.400 --> 56:18.640
We are doing a promo where if you buy the backpack, so let's go ahead.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.000
I'll see if I can show this to you guys.

56:21.040 --> 56:21.760
Should be good to go.

56:22.320 --> 56:30.480
If you buy the backpack, add that to your cart and a meme pillow, like say for example,

56:30.480 --> 56:38.480
this one, Sad Linus or Linus Selfie, we will give you the meme pillow for free.

56:40.400 --> 56:40.880
There it is.

56:40.880 --> 56:41.920
Free pillow with backpack.

56:43.440 --> 56:45.680
So it'll, it'll automatically apply the discount.

56:45.680 --> 56:48.960
You guys can check that out at lttstore.com.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.560
We've also got some restocks.

56:50.560 --> 56:55.920
We have new towel colors and the existing towels are back in stock.

56:55.920 --> 57:01.520
So we actually sold out a particularly the large ones extremely quickly last time around.

57:01.520 --> 57:02.880
Those are apparently better too.

57:02.880 --> 57:05.120
I don't know if it's in the notes, but Nick was talking to me about how

57:06.560 --> 57:11.120
they did a new fabric softening thing in production, which makes them absorb more

57:11.120 --> 57:14.480
water, dry faster and something else that I don't remember.

57:14.480 --> 57:16.480
I'm sorry, Nick, but yeah, apparently they're better.

57:16.480 --> 57:17.440
Go team.

57:17.440 --> 57:19.120
We've got two new t-shirts designed.

57:19.120 --> 57:20.560
Holy crap, there really is a lot of stuff.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.160
There's a lot of stuff going on this week.

57:22.960 --> 57:28.160
The sketchy PC t-shirt, which is sketchy because it's like a sketch.

57:28.160 --> 57:28.960
Haha, get it.

57:30.800 --> 57:33.680
The sketchy PC t-shirt is now available.

57:33.680 --> 57:40.160
And also what Northern Lights, you could think of this as kind of like a spiritual

57:40.160 --> 57:42.560
successor to the old constellations shirt.

57:43.440 --> 57:44.720
Pretty sick.

57:44.720 --> 57:47.200
I've already gotten one compliment on it.

57:47.280 --> 57:51.760
It was from my daughter, so I'm not sure if that counts, but I think that definitely counts.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.280
Yeah, she was like, that's a cool shirt.

57:53.280 --> 57:54.080
Is that from your store?

57:54.720 --> 57:56.480
I'm like, yeah, yeah, it is.

57:58.880 --> 58:02.320
We also brought back, oh, we brought back the expensive edition CPU pillow.

58:02.320 --> 58:03.680
Oh, for crying out loud, you guys.

58:04.400 --> 58:08.080
Okay, well, apparently we brought back the expensive edition CPU pillow.

58:08.080 --> 58:12.720
So if you want to show that you have more money than cents and your way of doing that

58:12.720 --> 58:15.360
is by putting something on your couch, well, there it is.

58:15.360 --> 58:20.800
For $169.99, you too can be the proud owner of an expensive edition CPU pillow.

58:23.120 --> 58:23.760
Really?

58:23.760 --> 58:25.520
People who buy this thing are happy with it.

58:27.200 --> 58:28.320
It feels like a ripoff.

58:28.320 --> 58:29.040
Yeah, exactly.

58:29.040 --> 58:30.960
I mean, that's what I'm talking about.

58:30.960 --> 58:32.080
Wait, it feels empty.

58:32.080 --> 58:33.520
Okay, oh, okay.

58:33.520 --> 58:38.480
So that's, it does take a little while to puff up, and it does smell bad out of the box.

58:39.760 --> 58:40.560
A pack of wool.

58:41.360 --> 58:41.680
Yeah.

58:42.480 --> 58:43.840
So that's something to be aware of.

58:43.920 --> 58:49.520
Like I have ones that I've had deployed on my couch for a long time, and they're very puffy.

58:49.520 --> 58:54.640
But if they've just been sitting, especially under a pile for a while, they can compress.

58:54.640 --> 59:01.360
And I would strongly recommend that you put them out to air out somewhere for a week

59:01.360 --> 59:06.320
before you put, bury your face in them and smell them because they come from alpacas.

59:06.320 --> 59:10.720
And so they smell like alpacas right out of the box.

59:10.720 --> 59:14.400
We actually had a very, very low star rating on this product

59:14.400 --> 59:17.680
until we updated the description to include this.

59:18.480 --> 59:23.840
Please note that due to the 100% alpaca wool fill, there may be a bit of an odor to this pillow,

59:23.840 --> 59:25.760
especially when you first take it out of the box.

59:27.280 --> 59:30.080
Yeah, significant direct sunlight for the first few days.

59:30.080 --> 59:33.200
That's what we recommend, and that's been fixing problems for most people.

59:35.600 --> 59:37.600
Frey says mine only smelled for about two days.

59:37.600 --> 59:38.160
Okay, there you go.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.160
Did you come back every hour?

59:40.160 --> 59:41.360
I'm like, see if it still smelled?

59:41.360 --> 59:43.440
Like, how do you know exactly how many days it smelled for?

59:43.440 --> 59:43.760
You know what?

59:43.760 --> 59:44.240
It doesn't matter.

59:44.240 --> 59:49.680
The point is, the last thing that I want to update you guys on is this.

59:53.200 --> 59:55.120
We are apparently doing a onesie.

59:55.680 --> 59:59.280
This is Bridget's project, her pet project.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.040
I take no responsibility for this.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:09.760
I approved moving forward with production on one print, not two, one.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:16.000
Okay, so this is the same prism design from the women's underwear.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.160
So if you want to see a bit of a higher quality image,

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.680
you can just go in the store and check out any of the women's underwear products.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.680
And this is the confetti design also from the women's underwear.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.120
You can get a better picture of it there.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.000
And we want to know, Luke, can you create a poll?

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.880
Prism versus confetti, let us know what you guys want to see.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.000
Yeah, float plane chat's already like, I am so down for this.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.680
Yeah, okay.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.200
No, do both.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.560
No, there's no feet.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.920
No, there's no feet.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.680
I am just wearing socks.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.080
It's just an elastic ankle.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.360
All right, so we'll get a poll up for that.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.080
And sorry, Nick didn't even want me to do all this stuff today,

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.120
but I was like, no, it's okay.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.480
We'll give more store updates.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.640
Luke, Luke, carabiner update.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.160
Let's do it.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.360
Hey, Dan, hey, Dan.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.600
Okay, Luke is going to be our test monkey.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.080
You're going to space today, Luke.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:20.560
Yes.

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.600
Let's hope you make it back.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.720
I've been waiting for so long.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:23.600
Okay.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.720
So am I going through the whole process?

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.120
Dan, don't move around too much.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.440
Just yell at Luke and tell him to go to the right place.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:33.520
Okay.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.480
All right, let me know when you're ready.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.680
He's working on it.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.680
Okay, the poll is working.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.760
Most people are going for confetti so far,

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.200
but it is pretty close.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:43.520
Okay.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.360
It's 41 to 59% so far.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:45.840
All right.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.320
We ready?

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.200
He's working on it.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.720
The tripod's locked and the cameras are hard.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.680
Are we good?

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.280
And again, am I going through the whole process?

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.040
Okay, Luke, Cam, here we go.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.440
Okay, so aim a little bit to Luke's side.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.280
Nope, nope.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.880
You want the table, table.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.440
There you go.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.320
Yep, there we go.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:05.920
There we go.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.480
All right.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.520
I do want you to do it on the table.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.160
So Luke, you get no instructions.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.600
You get the defective carabiner.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.760
So you want to show the design flaw real quick?

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.160
Okay.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:14.720
No, no, no.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.360
Stop doing that.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.560
No, Dan, don't follow him.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.520
You're going to give people motion sickness, you guys.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.960
Okay, so this is the old zipper?

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.000
Yep, okay.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.280
And the design flaw is there's like no rail on it,

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.640
and this is a hard pin down here.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.480
So if you press on the side, it would break.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.760
Do you want me to break it?

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.000
I mean, I don't feel like I need to break it.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.040
You can if you really want to.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.360
I think it's pretty easy to understand.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.240
This one has a flaw.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.040
Just break it.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.200
Some of them are better than others,

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.080
but if you push hard enough, you can break it.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.040
It took a bit of force.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.640
Like I had to kind of send it.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.560
Most people, they haven't failed.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.200
Mine haven't failed.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.960
But some had particularly thin walls and failed very easily.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.960
So it was clear that we needed to recall this.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.080
It also could come down to like how you actually pull on the zipper

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:56.800
and stuff like that.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.720
Like I think the way that I pull on the zipper,

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.600
which is I grab this part, I grab this part,

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.720
it's not going to fail for me

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.040
because I don't apply any pressure to the actual arm.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.160
But we're still going to fix the problem

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.840
and we're going to fix it for everyone.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.120
So the kit that everyone will receive,

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:11.920
what are you doing right now?

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:13.440
I don't know.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.240
I'm messing around.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.280
Oh, okay.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.280
Can you show the parts that will be included in the kit?

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.960
So first of all, no, stop lifting it up.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.600
It's a little hard to see,

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.440
but you are going to get this little arm

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.600
that has kind of like a wider flat edge

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.880
and a thinner flat edge.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.080
That is for prying open the clasp on the zipper

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.440
that you currently have.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.440
And then last time we showed this off,

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.000
we had these like clamps that you had to squeeze this way.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.680
Yeah, that was not the real solution.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.640
No, so now this is the closing mechanism.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.520
Get to that later.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.800
We're going to show them how it works later.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.640
Okay, so first remove the defective pull.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.600
So that's with the...

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.760
Yep, I'm not giving you any instructions.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.040
So just do your best.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.360
Oh, you already removed it.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.880
Yeah, I was just kind of fiddling around.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.480
Luke, you're supposed to be doing a demo for crying out loud.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.480
You take this brass looking thing,

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.440
but it's probably not brass,

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.440
and put it in the zipper,

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.800
and then you just turn it to the side.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.200
Okay.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.240
It's very easy.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.120
Well, turn it then.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:09.440
Show them.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.000
Show the people.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.120
You have to show the people Luke.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:11.920
You put it in.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:12.240
Geez.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.200
And you turn it to the side.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.000
Great, okay.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.080
And it lifts it up just enough

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.840
that you can get a new one in.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.720
No, stop.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.400
I was trying to find it for myself.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.040
So this, the circle right here,

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.640
you can see it's very thin on this edge.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.040
Yes.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.280
That is very easy to get under it

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.280
once you've pried it open just a little bit.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.360
You don't have to send it to the moon

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.560
because you might actually break the...

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.360
I don't know what this part is.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.080
Might?

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:36.720
You will.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.280
You will.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:37.680
Yeah.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.040
It's not designed to be open and closed

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:39.600
a bunch of times.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.280
It's also not designed to be open super wide.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.600
It's designed to be closed once,

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.080
but what we found is you can probably get away

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.760
with anywhere from three to four

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.600
before they will definitely fail.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.200
But you should only ever really do one

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.800
because we're going to send you...

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.360
This.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.520
These awesome new zippers right here,

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.240
which are great.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.400
They're going to be probably a little bit smaller

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.840
just because I found that with them that tall...

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.480
They're pretty big.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.480
Yeah, they kind of were cumbersome.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.600
It could definitely be smaller.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.240
And then these ones are much better at dealing

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.520
with side to side force.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.680
So they're a single titanium piece

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.680
and they've just got like this little...

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.760
It's hard to see, but there's like slots in it here

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.720
which allow it to bend.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.120
Yeah.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.680
And it's still not like if you really...

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.080
Oh, you could try and break it and you can break it.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.400
Yes, but you'd have to really crank it.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.480
Like you'd have to be trying to do damage to it.

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.640
Yeah, it's not going to happen by accident,

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.680
just pulling on the zipper,

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.280
which is what it's intended for.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.920
Okay, so go ahead and try to install it.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.360
Step one, yes.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.760
If I haven't actually done this, but...

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.640
Good, that's the whole point.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.280
Duh-duh-duh-duh.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.640
I'm trying to see.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.800
So I have the new zipper.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.720
I'm going to put it in the thingy-majiggy

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:45.680
that I just opened.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:47.760
Got it.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.720
This is hilarious.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.960
Audio Gary in Floatplane Chat is like,

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.040
can I just buy the zipper changing kit?

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.360
I have some busted up zippers that this would be lovely for.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:59.120
So now this thing, the only way to really get at it,

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.760
especially when it's in a bag, on a bag, whatever,

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.080
is going to be to go inside the zipper.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.960
Yep. So there's a little garage.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.960
Then we're going to move that out of the way.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.440
I'm very proud that I actually did contribute

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.960
to the final design for this.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.080
Part of the whole requirement is that,

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.760
while you do this, you pull a beard here out

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.120
with the microphone that's in front of you.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.000
So what, okay, I've got that in position now.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:22.720
That's pretty easy.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.800
You just kind of move it on and then it's done.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.440
A little garage there.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.160
And then I'm assuming you just turn this until you can't,

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.680
because that would be good design.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:37.200
And I feel like I'm probably done.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.400
Okay. Well, let's find out.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.720
I mean, loosen it back and then pull it off.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.000
Look, the idea here, guys, is that we are,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.960
we are testing this.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.720
We're testing this with a real user,

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.920
with no instructions, like real users will tend to,

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.800
dang it Luke.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.760
Okay, that's fine. We're good.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.480
Okay, sorry. I'll do it on the flat surface.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.600
Okay, try and get it out.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.640
Try and get it out of the gap where the people can see.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.760
Yeah, that's not coming out.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.600
Again, that's a situation like I'm putting enough force on this

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.480
where I'd have to be trying to damage it in order to do that.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.960
Okay. Now, you guys are probably wondering,

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.880
well, why aren't you just done yet then?

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:25.600
The answer is that we still have a couple of things to fine tune.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:29.760
Did Titan provide any of the re-tighteners that broke?

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.440
Yeah, I don't think so.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.760
Okay. Well, we managed to break a couple of them

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.000
in the re-tightening process.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.840
Also, as you can probably imagine, these are 3D printed.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.360
And if we're going to be manufacturing, let's see.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.520
Quite nicely to whoever did this or whatever it is.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.120
40,000 of them.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.360
They're not going to be 3D printed.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.720
That would be stupid.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.160
They're going to be injection molded.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.000
Yeah, that's our fancy new printer.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:54.480
It's really cool.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.120
It's nice.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.880
Yeah. Anyway, but we're not doing 40,000 parts in it,

01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.520
tell you that much.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.400
Quite a bit more expensive.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.720
So we need to get molds done.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.200
We need to get 40,000 parts manufactured.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:09.680
Right?

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.800
Like making one of anything takes some time.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.200
Making a thousand of something takes more time.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.280
And then there's also all the zippers.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.360
One kit, but tons of poles.

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.840
Yeah. So we also have to manufacture like 160,000 zippers.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.200
Right?

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.640
Well, yeah, like that's the thing, right?

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.840
Is that I remember, I remember giving the team a hard time.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.760
I was like, hey, we're out of stock of bits.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.200
Because some of the bit sets for the screwdriver out of stock.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.360
I'm like, well, can we get more?

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.640
We got to get them quickly.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.040
And they're like, well, here's the thing, boss.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.720
How do you get that many so quickly?

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:48.480
Each pack is however many times however many packs.

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:51.200
You're asking me to order like a million bits.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.960
They only have so many machines, boss.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:56.400
And I'm like, oh.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.480
Someone in full plain chat said break it to show what it takes.

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.480
I don't want to do that because I don't know how many of these they have.

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.120
I have seen.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:05.520
Just do it.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:05.840
Hold on.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.160
Hold on.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.680
Let me let me just switch to the loot cam.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.520
And you can just hold it up where we can see what you're doing.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.480
Next to my face.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.120
Okay, Dan.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:18.720
Unbelievable.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.520
Oh, he was making kissing noises.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.640
Okay, so one little thing.

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.160
So I torqued it pretty far ready.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.520
Another resting position.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.800
I don't know if you guys can see that, but it's slightly to the side.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.200
But with how it's made, I could just do that.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.160
And yep, now it's perfect again.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.000
Because I can just bend it back the other way.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.240
We're not recommending that just to be very clear.

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:41.840
We're not saying do that over and over again.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.040
That would be really stupid.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.840
Any metal is going to 90 degree now is going to eventually break from fatigue.

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.600
And then I'm going to try to like put it back.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.720
Oh, Lordy.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.920
This is very painful.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.320
There it goes.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:54.560
Okay.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.400
That took a lot of effort.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.280
That would never happen under a normal use case.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.360
Never say never, but probably not.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:01.920
Yeah.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.080
Nothing is perfect.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.280
Everything can break.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.960
Yeah, everything can break.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.480
Someone's going to break one of these.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:06.880
Can happen?

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.320
Yeah.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.520
Yeah, ideally not the one you broke.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.240
Thanks for nothing.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:12.640
Wow.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.720
It's like, yeah.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.800
Here, you want a sandwich?

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.240
I digested this one already.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:24.880
It's got all the components of the sandwich and some other stuff.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.600
Some of them were used.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.520
I'll break the water bottle.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.320
Yeah, like we can.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.000
The ability to break something does not mean that it is poorly designed or weak.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.960
And like it can be because of the way that it's structured.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.640
It could be bent this way pretty much an unlimited number of times.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.520
Nothing is unlimited.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.720
Nothing is perfect.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.760
But this way.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:49.520
Yeah, you could break that eventually.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.680
I got it slightly past 90.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.480
Like the use case where that's going to happen is crazy.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.840
You'd have to get caught on something.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.760
You would have to do something very bad to it.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.000
Cool.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.240
In which case, like, yeah, it's just going to be a problem.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.360
Like it takes some effort.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:05.920
Yeah.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.600
Sure, you can break it if you drag the metal beyond 90 degrees.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.560
Like, I don't know.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:10.960
All right.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.520
I'm excited.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.480
It's going to take some time.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.160
We've got a lot of stuff to manufacture.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.280
But then we got there.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.960
When we figured out that we were going to have to deal with that,

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.240
to be clear, there was never any question of whether we were going to deal with it or not.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.520
Trust me, bro.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:40.480
But the question of how and at what cost, obviously, those need to be answered.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:40.720
Yeah.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:43.840
The cost is very high.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.920
Well, yeah, it's a lot of stuff.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.040
It's a lot of titanium.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:47.680
And they're nice.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.960
It's four pulls per bag.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.240
It's OK.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.400
That's OK.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.560
That's what profit margins are for, right?

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.760
No, profit margins are for profit.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.480
If you must consume them with a product recall, then you do it.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.760
But that's not what they're for.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.400
But you need to have some of it just in case.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.840
They're for building labs.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.080
Yeah.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.600
Hiring people.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.680
So many new people lately.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.040
I have some bad news about that, by the way, which we can talk about after the show.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:21.520
Yep.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:21.920
All right.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:23.440
Cool.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:26.640
Yeah, hit me.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.320
OK, first up today is from Robert Linus.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.160
What do you think are the biggest advantages and disadvantages of ADHD?

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.640
If you need help, I forgot what it was.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.560
I was going to ask why I was buying this.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.160
Oh, yeah.

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.680
So I mean, I think it's pretty well documented.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:52.080
Hyper focus slash like, you know, dragon energy creativity is, I would say,

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.520
the biggest benefits for me.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.320
The biggest drawback is if I am not interested in something,

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.640
I basically cannot force myself to do it.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.040
And that has all kinds of negative implications in life, you know,

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.120
whether it's flunking out of school, whether it's, you know, difficulty,

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:19.200
fostering relationships, because you just ain't interested in what that person's talking about

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:24.640
and no amount of trying to make yourself focus on it will make you retain any of it.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:36.320
I think my best survival, my best survival strat has been to just surround myself with

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.880
people that I am interested in so that I don't have to deal with that kind of thing.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.400
I'm going to make my own company where everyone is someone that I would want to talk to because

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.280
if there's someone I don't want to talk to, I'm simply not able to do it.

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.640
Yeah, it's tough.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.160
I mean, and everyone, everyone's a little bit different.

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.160
You know, I think just trying to apply one label to everybody when we're all such

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:05.200
complicated creatures full of, you know, chemicals and electrical impulses and all

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.280
kinds of fun things is brain drugs.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.040
Yeah, it's very challenging, right?

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.160
But for me anyway, that's my experience.

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.080
Okay, hit me with another.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:16.800
Here comes another.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.320
Next one's from George.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.400
How has your approach to content creation changed over the years and what strategies

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.560
do you use to keep your audience engaged and interested in your videos?

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.040
Did you pick related questions on purpose?

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.560
I try and create a theme.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:38.400
Because basically my approach changes when I get bored and my boredom happens a lot faster

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.160
than yours because I have ADHD.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.000
So that's the idea, right?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.440
It has actually helped a lot.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.960
Yeah, like I remember there was this outcry from the audience when we stopped doing power

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.440
supply unboxings, right?

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.000
What?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.400
You're not going to do power supply unboxings anymore?

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:01.840
Same thing happened when we stopped doing motherboard unboxings and all these different

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.480
categories that we covered at some point and then basically just went on board and stopped doing.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:12.160
And even though, you know, a significant portion of the audience was upset about it,

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:19.280
the channel never did anything but grow at those points because even if they didn't realize it,

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.240
they were going to get bored.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.520
It was going to happen and something had to change.

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.320
And I knew that at that time we weren't set up to change the way that we approached covering

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.040
those products.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:38.400
We didn't have the funding or the knowledge or the experience to do detailed power supply

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.760
testing, for example.

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.280
So that wasn't going to happen.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:46.720
So the better thing for us to do was to go find something that did excite us and go do that

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.600
instead.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.320
And it worked.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.640
We also do listen to the audience.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:57.040
You can't just ignore the audience and just do whatever Whim strikes you.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.840
That's not going to be a good content creation strategy either.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:04.720
So figuring out how to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to audience feedback

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.800
and then trusting your instincts as well.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:14.720
I mean, don't imagine that we're never Chroma cost us, but I believe it's fully set up now,

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.240
like actually like physically set up.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.120
And I believe they're coming for training like in the matter of days or weeks.

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.240
It's not months.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.160
And oh, you want to know something really cool?

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:30.880
The RF chamber, two days into its 10 day construction right now.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.600
Oh, cool.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:31.840
Yeah.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.240
The texts are here building it right now.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:34.720
That's awesome.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:34.960
Yeah.

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.760
I'm really excited.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:42.800
RF chamber is going to be great because covering stuff like wireless router.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.880
How do you do it?

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.200
Right?

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:48.720
Like obviously, you know, I tried to find ways back in the day.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.520
Like I in my old house, for example,

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.240
I would put them in the same place every time and I had like a handful of places

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:01.040
that I would check and then I'd be like, okay, yeah, the signal strength and transmission

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:08.240
data rate are X and X minus Y and X plus Y or X plus Z or whatever for all these different

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:08.640
products.

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:12.080
And it's like something, but it's not scientific.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.280
It's not repeatable, right?

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.440
So the RF chamber is going to change all of that.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.680
Very, very excited and not just wireless routers.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.880
Like we're talking cell phones.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.400
We're going to have our own like 4G, 5G network thing.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.640
Which phone has the best reception?

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.600
Literally, nobody covers that.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.240
They're phones, ostensibly.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:40.480
And yet we don't talk about the fact that my phone, I can't carry on a conversation

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.840
even though I'm on the same network as my wife and she can.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:47.600
I feel like this used to be a thing like a decade or more ago.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.160
Totally was.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.840
And now it's not really covered at all.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.560
Yeah.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.440
Josh, you're crazy.

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.320
It's annoying.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.200
I want to know why I can hear Luke's phone on the mics and I can't hear Linus's or mine.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:57.840
Right?

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.040
That would be amazing.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:17:59.760
That would actually be pretty interesting.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.560
We should test like my stupid phone.

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.000
I've always wanted to know that.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:04.800
Interesting.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:05.840
I'm super into it.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.280
Okay.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.600
Let's do some rapid fire now.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.680
Actually be rapid fire.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.160
Okay.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.440
What's our time limit?

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.240
Do you have a timer?

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.560
40 minutes ago.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:17.920
Let's go.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.040
I told Dan he's supposed to have a timer for rapid fire,

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.960
but he has ADHD so he didn't do it.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.680
I forgot.

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.560
We can use the pain timer.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:26.960
Here we go.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.080
My daughter is a big fan.

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.200
She wanted to ask Linus,

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.400
is excited for the new legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.760
Have you seen the demo footage?

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.040
Vehicle building looks insane.

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.480
It was two seconds sigh.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.640
I hate giving Nintendo money, but I'm going to do it anyway.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.880
The only way I can get you a timer.

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.480
This is going to be really confusing.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:48.800
All right.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.680
Let's get rid of that then.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.320
I haven't watched any of the demos for the same reason

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.880
that I don't watch trailers of movies I know I'm going to watch.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.640
I'm going to play it.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.520
With that said, I felt, you know, when you finish a game

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.040
or a book or a movie and you're like...

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:06.800
That's good.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.000
It ended at the right time.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:08.480
It's done.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.800
When I beat Ganondorf at the end of Breath of the Wild,

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.440
I wasn't one of those people who has gone back

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.560
over the last three or four years and played it more.

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.920
I loaded it up recently because I wanted to try it on the ROG

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:28.000
ally with Simu and just kind of see what the performance was like.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:28.560
Amazing.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:30.960
Like so much better than the Switch.

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.200
Anyway, so I fired it up.

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.600
And even in the beginning areas of the game,

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.040
like I couldn't fight anything.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.640
I almost died just like fighting stupid, basic,

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.480
pecobloons or whatever they're called.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.480
And I'm sitting here going, oh crap,

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.920
when Tears of the Kingdom comes out,

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.000
I'm going to have to learn this all over again.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.200
I'm going to suck.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.240
Whereas like I had no problem farming like the top tier

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.920
equipment from whatever those like horsey Centaur guys

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.960
or whatever like that.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.120
I was like good.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.040
Like I beat the game or whatever.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.560
Anyway, I hate giving Nintendo money.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.600
I'm going to do it anyway.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.120
But I'm going to give them my money.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.680
And then I'm going to play it on my ally if I can.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.920
I hate that my save data is stuck on the stupid Switch.

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.480
Oh yeah, for sure.

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.440
I want something I can back out.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.320
Actually dangerous.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:22.640
Yeah.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.360
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.680
Okay, next up with the prices of Nvidia's 4000 series,

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.400
do you think their 5000 series will be even more expensive?

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:30.640
Yep.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:31.760
Okay.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.960
Yeah, you're getting better at this.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.480
Atlas OS sounds like a perfect solution to bloatware on new setups.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.200
But how would you work around potential software or data loss

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.360
using on a machine that has existing software?

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.480
I'm so glad you brought up Atlas OS because there's been some

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.120
outcry in the community over our promotion of the project.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:52.480
So first of all, I just want to say we did include a list, not exhaustive,

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.840
but it did include most of the major concerns from people in the community

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.080
of potential downsides to Atlas OS, including the fact that it disables UAC,

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:07.520
disables Windows Defender, it handicaps Windows Update.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.440
So there are definitely issues with Atlas OS the way that it is.

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:15.200
The main point that we wanted to feature it was we wanted to demonstrate

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.520
what an unbloated Windows can look like.

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:21.840
And the Atlas OS devs are well enough aware of the issues

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.640
and they're actually working on them, which is really, really exciting.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:28.400
So it's great that people are giving their feedback about those concerns,

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:31.440
and it's great that the Atlas devs are taking the whole thing seriously.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.360
I saw a lot of people making really weird suggestions like

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.880
you shouldn't use Atlas OS, it's sketchy, you should use a de-bloater.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:43.360
Atlas OS is a de-bloater, it's open source.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.560
That's not to say that it's perfect in its current iteration.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.960
There's definitely stuff that they need to work on in order to make it safer

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.960
to daily drive for regular users.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:57.280
As it is right now, you should only use it if you 100% know what you're doing

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.680
and if you are running a third-party antivirus,

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.800
if there's any risk whatsoever of you doing something, whoops.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.400
Which, frankly, with how sophisticated cyber attacks are these days,

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:09.440
is a non-zero chance for anyone, even you.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.600
Something could happen, right?

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:14.160
Yep.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:15.760
Okay, next up.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.040
I think, sorry, I just want, if you're wanting to set it up,

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:24.400
like imagine the racing sim up there.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.720
Like, say it was one of those types of computers,

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.520
all you ever do is update the game through Steam.

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.600
You don't browse ever, all that kind of stuff.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.840
Maybe you can get by with it, but it's not a good idea to run completely antivirus-less.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:38.560
Sorry, keep going.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.840
But I think I made the mistake in that video of just kind of-

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.520
Brushing it over, brushing it a little bit too.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.320
Well, I didn't actually watch it.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:49.920
More assuming that I was talking to my audience,

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:56.400
instead of accounting for that a lot of people who watch our videos are not, like,

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.960
dialed in.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.440
Yeah.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.120
You know, they're not watching every day.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.280
They're not advanced users necessarily.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.880
And I think that was a little irresponsible.

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:11.200
On that subject, actually, there's another thing that I was probably a little irresponsible

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.160
about and is worth addressing at this point.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.240
We talked about Nebula a couple of weeks ago,

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:22.000
and their CEO posted in their subreddit that I got basically everything wrong,

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.240
which is one way of saying it.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.200
There are a couple of things that I miscommunicated,

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.400
and there are a couple of things that I misunderstood.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.400
And I think most of it is just due to the fact that I had outdated information,

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:40.480
which I really should have accounted for.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:45.840
I also did a really poor job of explaining when I said that a subscription,

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:50.800
out of a subscription, very little of that money would go to the individual creator.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.760
And what I meant was that if I, a creator,

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.360
sold a subscription to Nebula to my audience,

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:02.080
I would get very little of that over the lifetime of that subscriber.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.640
That's not to say that I get very little money.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.320
That's to say that it's a completely different model.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.160
I don't know how their thing works.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:13.680
If someone subscribed and then only watched your content,

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.880
like is it divided based on what content they watch?

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:19.360
Theoretically, it's based on watch time.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:23.360
So if someone only watched the person they subscribed to

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.560
and nobody else ever.

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:25.920
That I don't know.

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:30.560
That I don't know, but based on that, it's an all-you-can-eat platform

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.400
where you subscribe to the entire library.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.600
You'll probably watch other stuff.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:43.200
See, I don't, my goal isn't to out anyone or anything here either,

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:50.720
but the way that I approached that saying that it seemed like

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.680
people were more into the part ownership, which is a really good thing,

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:54.080
by the way.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.200
The fact that the creators are part owners in the platform.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:00.640
But the way that I approached that saying, okay, well,

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:03.200
they're doing this thing where they have these lifetime subscriptions,

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.680
it seems like they're trying to boost subscriber count.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.760
Maybe it's an exit strategy or whatever else.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:11.360
The reason I said that was not because I didn't think the platform was profitable.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.600
It's been pretty clear that they're profitable for a long time.

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.800
Dave posted on Twitter a month ago, I think,

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:20.160
that they're spending half a million dollars on YouTube advertising a month

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:20.960
or something like that.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.560
For me, it was not a question of, are they profitable?

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.200
It was a question of, what's the purpose of this here?

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.760
Like, why do you need a quarter million dollars in funds

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.360
if you're spending half a million dollars a month on advertising

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.880
through YouTube or whatever the case may be?

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:41.840
The other thing too is that, as far as I could tell,

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.880
and again, this is outdated conversations, it's like a year ago,

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:49.200
with people that I've talked to that have left the platform,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.360
no, it wasn't generating a significant amount of money for them.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.280
So, I don't know.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.120
So, I guess what I'm trying to say is there's definitely things that I missed.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.640
Dave made it very clear that they're not heading towards an exit.

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:11.200
So, I'm still confused about the lifetime membership, but sure.

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.400
And I think that's everything that I wanted to clarify.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.480
I had a lot of people comment to me directly, actually,

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:26.480
that they thought it was weird that I was commenting on a competitor.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.480
And Davis said publicly already, and I've said before,

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.080
I don't see them as a competitor.

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.600
They're not in the same space.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.880
It's a very different model.

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:40.000
They have video on their website, but that's about where the similarities end.

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:43.600
I think you could say that we're more of a Patreon competitor,

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.800
if we weren't an ant that Patreon would squish under their heel, right?

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.280
Like, we're...

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.160
We just kind of do our own thing.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.600
Float Plane's Float Plane, man.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:59.760
Maybe it'll take off someday, and if it doesn't, hey, it ain't going to sink.

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.240
That's literally what the branding means.

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.840
And it's been a massive success for us internally.

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.160
Like, we don't hide the numbers, right?

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.920
We've got over 42,000 monthly subscribers on Float Plane right now.

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:17.120
It's actually been a really exciting last few months for Float Plane.

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.680
And we passed the one-month anniversary of the hack.

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.920
So that's people that stayed around.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.240
Well, yeah, there's really good content.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:24.640
Yeah.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.720
We actually saw no real noticeable dip on the anniversary of the hack.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.760
And like many of the creators that...

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:35.280
You know what?

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.560
I think I've said enough.

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:42.400
That's pretty much all I have to say about it.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:46.000
Our model works for us, their model works for them, and that's fine.

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:46.800
Yeah.

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.920
And I'm glad they're not heading for an exit.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.080
Because something that I've always said is it's been nice having them in the space because,

01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:00.640
while I don't see them as a competitor, the landscape of, hey,

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.960
you can support us outside of main platform that we are on,

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.600
whether that's YouTube or Instagram or Twitch or whatever else.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.960
Growing that at all is cool because it legitimizes that space.

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.000
How different companies decide to approach that in like Nebula's model,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.600
or Float Plane's model, or Patreon's model, or whoever else's model,

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.720
they can be ever more different from each other.

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.600
And I think Float Plane and Nebula are quite different.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.280
But it's just nice having more people in that space because it normalizes it, which is good.

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:33.520
Yeah.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:36.560
Moving on.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:38.720
Okay.

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.640
Oh, man, what do you want to talk to now?

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.320
Let's talk about the Mountain to Dead Chromebooks.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.000
Yeah.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.920
I think this is interesting.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.040
I think you're being a hater right now.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.960
So I'm going to make you read the topic.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:51.760
You read the topic.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:52.320
All right, sounds good.

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.400
School struggle with mountains of dead Chromebooks.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:54.400


01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:59.680
During the pandemic, American schools bought a massive number of Chromebooks.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.160
Massive.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:05.200
According to a recent report, those schools now have a massive number of unusable devices.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:05.920
Unusable.

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:07.920
Massive.

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:08.720
Unusable.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:09.440
I'm your hype man.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:14.000
In part because of the obvious cheapness of the materials,

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.240
but also because the devices are hitting the end of their security updates.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.120
Officially, Chromebooks get five to eight years of updates.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.160
Five to eight years.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:28.560
But their auto expiration date is determined by when the device was certified, not when it was sold.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.040
Google tells users to expect an average of four years of updates

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.320
at time of sale.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.720
After Chromebooks pass that expiration date,

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:43.200
they can no longer access secure websites, including state testing sites.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:45.920
Okay.

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.200
Pointless changes to basic parts between different models

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:51.040
make the Chromebooks difficult to repair.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:54.880
For example, six different manufacturers of the Chromebook 11

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.600
made cosmetic changes to the plastic bezel

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.480
that made parts incompatible between models.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.800
Luckily or not,

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:08.160
many schools have large stockpiles of busted Chromebooks to salvage parts from.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:11.280
But salvage is inefficient by design.

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.800
Usually, if a Chromebook has a single broken key,

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.800
the entire keyboard needs to be replaced.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.840
One school official reported that a typical repair involves replacing half the device.

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:27.040
There was an interesting anecdote from Wednesday's TechLinked episode

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.120
where Gideon Fraser commented,

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.200
fun fact, after having worked as a hardware tech guy in a Georgia school,

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:38.800
I can go ahead and tell you that these Chromebooks are actually closer to 90 US dollars a piece,

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.280
and these kids obliterate them.

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.160
If a key is bad, you can go to the back room,

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.240
fill to the brim with broken Chromebooks,

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.280
look for one with a functional keyboard and part match.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:54.080
Actually, you do that with every fixable component on these God awful machines.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:57.200
We don't really buy any parts replacements

01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:01.360
because we already have enough broken ones that we should have any part we would need

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.680
that would actually be a viable to fix.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.200
And then another person responded as well,

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.560
as a fellow tech in Texas,

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:12.640
I can confirm those damn screens are just constantly coming in shattered.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:15.200
This just in.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.280
Kids not careful with their things,

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.600
especially when they aren't their things.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:20.080
Yeah.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:20.960
More at 11.

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:21.280
Yeah.

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:26.000
I don't think them breaking often would be different

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.600
if it was a Chromebook or not.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.720
I actually don't either.

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:32.000
I think the kids would be very likely to break school-owned laptops,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.760
regardless of whether they were Chromebooks or Macbooks or Windowsbooks or whatever.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:40.960
I used to get so enraged at how people would treat the computers in the computer labs.

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.960
The lab that you and your friends built?

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:43.200
Yeah.

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.280
But even the ones that we didn't,

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:49.760
because we had such a low budget that if you break the optical drive on this thing,

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.880
we don't get another one.

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:53.120
And people would be shoving garbage.

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:57.120
They would take candy wrappers and put in the optical drive and shove it closed.

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:00.000
Like, I used to have a little tool that I would walk around with

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.320
to be able to do the manual pop out of optical drive

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.320
so I could pull them open and take trash out.

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.520
It's so annoying.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:11.200
If you don't destroy everything,

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:14.560
more of the budget can go towards making this place nice.

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:15.760
Yeah.

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.080
Can we stop?

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.320
Man, it used to be so frustrating.

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.160
So I'm not surprised that people would trash these.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.000
This is going to happen with whatever.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.080
And I don't believe most laptop keyboards that I know of

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:33.360
have user repairable individual keys.

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:38.800
So a lot of these complaints, I'm coming down on like,

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.120
I don't know if I can rag on the Chromebook for this.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.640
No, it's not Chromebook specific,

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:47.040
but what is very frustrating is the fact that these devices will expire

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.400
that yes on average in four years.

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:50.800
Yeah.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:55.040
I mean, I just bought a Chromebook for my middle child

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:58.880
because she needs it for school next year.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.040
And I'm sitting here going, well,

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.560
I didn't think to check if it was certified

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.840
like yesterday or a year ago or two years ago or four years ago.

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.880
It's modern hardware.

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.360
So probably it was certified fairly recently,

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.440
but I didn't think to check that.

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.960
And I can see how that would be exactly the sort of thing

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.640
that whether it's a parent or whether it's a buyer

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.320
for a school district or whatever else,

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:25.040
there's so many other factors to consider other than

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.560
when the device was certified that honestly,

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.360
I straight up think that this should just be illegal.

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.720
And laptops are better now.

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:36.560
They're like, when I was kind of late high school,

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:38.400
it was general wisdom that if you bought a laptop,

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.120
it lasted three years.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:39.280
Yeah.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.440
Within three years, it was going to be crap anyway.

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:42.480
That's not really a thing anymore.

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.520
That's not true.

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:47.280
You could buy a ThinkPad that's 10 years old on like eBay,

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:51.680
you know, like that's core, second gen core, third gen core.

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:55.280
I mean, oh, I mean, fourth gen core is almost 10 years old

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.080
at this point.

01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.560
And that'll be very usable today.

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:01.280
As long as you can make sure that you get proper security on it,

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.800
you update the heck out of it,

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.800
and then you're just like browsing the internet.

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.840
That's fine.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:06.560
Who cares?

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.240
So what is our justification for allowing this stuff

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.920
to just expire this way?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.440
And back to the part that I think should actually be illegal,

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:19.680
why are we allowing companies to continue selling these products

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:23.440
well into their lifespan knowing that what the customer is

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.440
buying today is a significantly shorter shelf life

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.960
than what they bought at the beginning of the product cycle.

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.920
You should have to, well, you shouldn't really be able to do it all,

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:36.720
but you should have to communicate like this device has 800 days left

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.520
until it is garbage when you buy the thing.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.920
Well, if you're going to hard lock it like that,

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:45.440
I mean, if it's going to be a degraded experience, okay, fine.

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:48.160
You know, like Apple doesn't roll out new macOS updates

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.920
for their Macs forever.

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:52.560
At some point, you do have to deprecate the hardware.

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:54.160
That actually is fine.

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.280
It would be enormously burdensome for them to have to support it forever.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.400
It's not what I'm asking for.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:03.440
Someone in floatplane chat, MikeD78 said,

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.560
I'm watching this show on a fourth gen i5 ThinkPad.

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.680
Works fine.

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.800
Exactly, right?

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.440
And so what I'm saying is knowing

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.240
that assuming the kids don't beat the crap out of it,

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:19.680
the hardware could still be good in more than four years

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.440
or even more than five or eight years.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.000
It should be communicated.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.320
And this is something that I will often tell people

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.360
when they're shopping for a phone.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.440
When people ask me for advice for a phone,

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.560
I almost never give an exact model because

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.040
then it's my problem if they don't like it.

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:37.840
But what I will do is I'll give them some tech tips.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:42.080
And one of the ones that I will really, really try to emphasize is,

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.360
hey, you need to think about it in terms of total cost of ownership.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:49.440
And I know that that's more of a business the way of considering things.

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.520
But in our personal lives, it's very applicable.

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.120
If you buy a brand new iPhone today, right,

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.720
you can buy a brand new iPhone from the last generation.

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.520
It's cheaper, right?

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.600
It's also not as good,

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.800
but a big part of the reason it's cheaper is not the hardware.

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.400
It's the support.

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.520
So if the difference in price between a,

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.200
let's just use arbitrary numbers,

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:21.520
between a $1,000 iPhone and an $800 iPhone, okay, is one-fifth.

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:25.680
But that $1,000 one is going to last for five years.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:29.040
And that $800 one is going to stop getting support in four years.

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:29.520
Guess what?

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.880
They're the same.

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.360
Are you wanting me to say it?

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:35.920
Sure.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.440
Cost of ownership, total cost of ownership.

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.240
Exactly.

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.400
Now that's not always true, right?

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:42.160
It depends what kind of user you are.

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:46.080
Are you the type of person that uses your devices into the ground?

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.600
Well, okay, then what I just said is very applicable.

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.840
But if you're the kind of person who's going to upgrade in two years or three years anyway,

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:59.920
then it becomes more of a question of, well, are the features important to you?

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.560
As opposed to just the total cost you're going to pay per year of owning the device,

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:04.800
right?

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.800
Because then all of a sudden they're the same in terms of their software expiry.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.040
So you start to move on to other factors.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.200
But it's a really important thing to consider, especially with Android phones.

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.400
Buying a year old Android phone, particularly a few years ago,

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.560
when they weren't getting support the same way that, I mean,

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.040
Samsung does four years now, I think, three.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.680
Yeah, if you don't mind looking that up, that would be good to know.

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.360
But there was a while there where you were getting one, two,

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.320
very rarely three major Android updates on your Android phone.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:40.960
Four years.

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:41.440
Four years.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.960
Yeah, so they do four years now at least.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:49.120
But it wasn't always that way and not all vendors have that level of commitment.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:53.680
And so if you're buying it a year into the cycle, don't be fooled.

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.240
If it's 20% off, that ain't a deal.

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:01.840
You're just buying old hardware at full price, right?

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:03.360
For how long you're going to be able to use it.

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:09.840
So our latest pixels are apparently five years now, which is really great.

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.560
And yeah, it's a major factor that you should consider.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:14.960
We're supposed to do sponsors now.

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:15.600
Thanks, Dan.

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:19.200
The show is brought to you today by MSI.

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:25.920
Introducing the MSI MPG A850G PCIe 5.0 Modular Gaming Power Supply.

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.520
Really rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:33.280
It's a great power supply for the ultimate gaming experience with support for GeForce

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.800
40 series graphics cards.

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.480
It can deliver the power and performance needed for the latest games and graphics

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.760
heavy applications.

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:45.120
Its full modular design and compact size will help keep your PC clean and organized.

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:50.160
Its 80 plus gold certification means high efficiency with minimal heat generation.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:55.760
It features 100% Japanese 105 degree Celsius capacitors and industrial level protection

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.920
against power surges and other hazards, meaning the MPG A850G is built to last.

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:06.400
So upgrade your gaming PC today with the MPG A850G PCIe 5.0 80 plus gold

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:08.640
full modular gaming PSU.

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.560
They really do have a way with words MSI, don't they?

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:15.920
The show is also brought to you by Vessi.

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.520
Oh, what's up, Dan?

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.320
He needs a second.

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.880
Here's a wild Dan needs a second.

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.120
This is what Dan needing a second looks like.

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:26.560
It's been more than one second, Dan.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.760
You'll see as the operator of the show ponders over what steps he must take next

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:36.080
in order for the sponsor section to continue.

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:39.200
The Dan doesn't look like he's doing anything, but he's thinking.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:40.640
There we go.

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.480
Having found Riley's crotch, we can continue.

01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:42.960
There it is.

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:43.760
I can see it now.

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.840
Okay, let's try this again.

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.480
Number two.

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.520
Wetness is not something that everyone enjoys, especially...

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.280
Yeah, we're having problems with the videos here.

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.160
I see.

01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.360
Okay, go for it.

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:57.680
Wetness is not something everyone enjoys, especially when it happens on your feet.

01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.720
But thankfully, we have a secret weapon, Vessi.

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:05.280
They claim their shoes are 100% waterproof thanks to their Dymotex technology.

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.280
Are we really just going to look at this image a little time?

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.560
Yeah, you just get to stare at his crotch.

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:12.000
Even the most torrential downpours don't stand a chance.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:15.120
If you're not stylish, like me, you need Vessi's.

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:16.400
Hey, ouch.

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.120
Their fashion forward design is perfect for any occasion.

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.400
They're stretchy and comfortable, and putting on a pair of Vessi's is a breeze.

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.840
They're also easy to get off.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:27.040
And thanks to their sock-like fit, you'll feel like you're walking on a cloud.

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:28.240
So go treat your feet.

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:33.440
Head to Vessi.com slash WAN Show to get 15% off your purchase with code WAN Show.

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.160
Do you need a minute?

01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.200
Should I do the other sponsor?

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:37.760
Oh, wow.

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:38.000
Oh.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:38.960
Wow, what am I looking at?

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:39.520
Okay, cool.

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.840
All right, we're going to look at that for the OK.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:47.600
Thanks to our sponsor, Acciflow.

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:50.320
Are you tired of juggling tasks from different apps?

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:55.200
Acciflow's universal inbox lets you take all your tasks from multiple platforms,

01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:00.160
like Gmail and Trello, and gather them onto one calendar so you can efficiently plan your day or

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:00.800
week.

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:04.960
Acciflow aims to solve that ever-so-common problem with time-blocking platforms,

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:09.200
with a time-blocking platform to keep you organized and on track.

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:12.400
That's actually super cool, being able to just consolidate all this stuff,

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:16.240
because sometimes you can't control if someone sends you a team's invite,

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:19.680
and someone else sends you a Google Calendar invite, and all that kind of stuff.

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:20.880
It's super easy to set up.

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:24.000
Just head over to their website, log in, connect your existing accounts,

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.160
and start time-blocking your days.

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.120
Block out your time.

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:27.840
Not your mind.

01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:32.000
Go to acciflow.com slash WAN and sign up for a seven-day trial for free.

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.640
Well, that went really smoothly.

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:36.640
Brand new sponsor.

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:36.960
Hey.

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:38.960
Good job, everyone.

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:39.600
No, it's okay.

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.560
We got this.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:41.120
We got this.

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:44.800
Dan, does your phone have a bird-chirping ringtone?

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.720
Okay, I have been wondering if I have been...

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:51.600
He's going outside.

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.960
What are you going to do about it?

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:53.440
Yeah, what?

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:54.480
I'll deal with it, Luke.

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.600
I said I would deal with it.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.480
We don't want you to deal with it that way.

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.480
I just thought...

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:03.120
I was genuinely concerned I was hallucinating.

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.360
No, I thought the same thing.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:06.400
I thought it was one of you guys,

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:08.320
because it's really quiet next to my head

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.360
and coming out of my microphone.

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.320
But yeah, we're all going insane.

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.480
As long as I'm not going insane, we can continue.

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:17.360
Carbon monoxide filter alarms getting really irritating.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.320
There's somebody on YouTube

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:24.160
sending 55 Canadian dollar super chats over and over again.

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.200
And I can't even see them to read them.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.520
Don't send super chats.

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:30.800
You buy stuff on the store.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.960
We like try to check them, but just don't do it.

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:34.160
And if you don't want to buy stuff,

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.840
just buy gift cards and never use them.

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:36.640
Yeah.

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.640
If you must just throw money at us.

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:39.920
It's like the world's worst bank.

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.760
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.400
You can only withdraw them in the form of...

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:45.680
Products.

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:47.040
Of high quality apparel.

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:49.840
I mean, that's not that bad actually.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.680
But you get no interest.

01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:53.280
Yeah.

01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.720
Except the interest you'll get

01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.880
from wearing our high quality apparel.

01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:58.320
Hey, you like that setup?

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:01.440
That was pretty good.

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:02.880
That was pretty good.

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.040
Oh, one of our topics today was response

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:08.160
to the Atlas OS video.

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:09.760
I guess I kind of jumped in.

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.960
I think we're done that one.

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:12.240
Yeah, I think we're good on that one.

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:16.400
Big accounts forcibly re-verified on...

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.200
Do we want to even talk about it?

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.240
I didn't say the name yet.

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:20.800
All right, you do it.

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:21.360
And skip it.

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.160
Oh, great.

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:22.960
We're talking about it.

01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.920
We're talking about it.

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:26.400
A bunch of big accounts are forcibly re-verified

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.120
on the Twitter.

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.440
Including the Atlas Tech account.

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:29.840
Yep.

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.280
And when we say forcibly...

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.320
Oh man, the narratives that people are creating

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.320
in their own heads about this.

01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.600
Like that celebrities were outraged

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.040
that they don't get to feel special

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.280
because of their verification check marks.

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.360
Or that they're just...

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.440
I don't know that this is...

01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:52.640
That this matters.

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.200
It's Twitter.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:53.760
I don't care.

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:55.040
Yeah, okay.

01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:55.520
Carry on.

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:58.080
For no stated reason,

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.960
Twitter has been haphazardly re-verifying

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:04.240
certain prominent accounts

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.440
without the consent of the account holder.

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.320
Well, okay.

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:10.560
I want to jump in and say the reason that matters

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:11.920
is because of what the badge says.

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:13.040
Of what the badge says.

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:14.960
The way that it's worded makes it sound

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:16.800
like you're a paying Twitter blue subscriber.

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.320
It says you are.

01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:19.200
Yes.

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.640
Quite specifically, yeah.

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:22.720
These check marks still say that the...

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:23.600
Oh, there it is.

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:24.960
Still says that the account is subscribed

01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:27.840
to Twitter blue, which seems unlikely

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.680
in the case of figures like Kobe Bryant,

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.800
Anthony Bourdain, Jamal Khashoggi,

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:35.280
a journalist who was murdered five years ago.

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:36.960
So yeah, I mean, that makes sense.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.840
Sometimes accounts of people who have passed

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.120
will be managed by a team and stuff like that, but yeah.

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:44.160
Probably not that one.

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:44.800
Probably not.

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.160
Some of the verifications appear to have been

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.360
given out of spite.

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.200
Prominent Twitter comedian at drill

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.120
who has advocated blocking accounts,

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.240
subscribed to Twitter blue,

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:58.960
was given a blue check mark several times

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.680
as he kept changing his profile name to get rid of it.

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:04.960
I actually don't subscribe to the conspiracy theory,

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.640
or the, well, the tinfoil hat theory about this.

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:12.560
I, well, okay.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:16.480
I was about to say I don't think Twitter management

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.280
is actually petty enough to go find individual users

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.120
and keep reverifying them.

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.440
I don't actually know that for sure,

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:25.280
but my understanding is it's basically

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:27.280
anyone with over a million followers

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:28.160
that's just getting.

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:29.600
It's just happening automatically.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.960
That's just getting re-verified.

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.480
It just seemed like a bug to me.

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:32.960
I don't know.

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.200
Probably some security thing back in the day

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:40.560
to like fix other bugs where it's like,

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.200
oh, this person accidentally lost their verification.

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:44.400
Let's just reapply it.

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.880
Yeah, drill has 1.8 million followers.

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.680
And interestingly is not verified right now.

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:50.800
Probably because they changed their name.

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:53.040
Slave to woke.

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:53.440
All right.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.920
Several fake accounts were also verified,

01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:59.440
including a fake Hillary Clinton

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.920
and an account pretending to represent

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.000
a Sudanese paramilitary group

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.080
when these tweeted falsely that the group's leader had died.

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:10.400
Okay.

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:13.600
Claiming that celebrities have subscribed to Twitter blue

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.760
when they have not may qualify as

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.000
in quotes, false endorsement

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.240
and exposed Twitter to legal action.

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:23.120
I suspect unless Twitter goes, sorry, it was a bug.

01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.120
And then the whole thing goes away.

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:25.440
Yeah.

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:28.160
I mean, I don't know.

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:29.920
That could be the defense.

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.920
They could also come up with something more creative.

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:34.000
There was the super creative.

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.480
You can't tell that that was me.

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:38.400
It could have been a deep fake defense.

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:43.120
For I don't, I particularly try not to follow this stuff.

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.480
So I'm not really sure what you're talking about.

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.800
We talked on the show about how this was going to happen though.

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:49.120
Yeah.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:54.000
Like 100% because when the deep fake stuff gets convincing enough,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:59.040
you can not only not really be able to believe what is actually real,

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:03.360
but you also, if something is real, it becomes hard.

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:08.880
It becomes very easy for people to kind of be like, nah, it's fake.

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:09.040
Yeah.

01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:10.640
This is this is great.

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.800
Tesla defense lawyers tell the court

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.680
that Elon Musk's statements could be deep fakes.

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.360
And this is in.

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:20.560
Do they just mean broadly or are they talking about one specific thing?

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:25.600
The judge in the autopilot death case where this is being presented

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:28.640
says that this defense argument is deeply troubling.

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:30.800
I mean, it is.

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.360
Especially because they weren't.

01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:36.480
But they're saying what they could be.

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:42.000
So anything that he's ever said about the capabilities of autopilot or whatever else.

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.560
Basically they're saying unless you were there in person,

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.800
you have no way of knowing that it wasn't a deep fake.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.320
So it should be just what inadmissible or.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.760
What a wild time.

01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:57.520
Is this a wild time or what?

01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:58.240
Twitter sucks.

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:05.600
It's convenient for connecting to people that you might need to talk to

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:08.320
because it has a lot of people on it.

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:11.200
It's my number one source of which celebrity died today.

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:16.720
Honestly, that probably makes sense.

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:18.000
That's how I found out that.

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:20.160
Oh, shoot.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.360
Now it's escaped me.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:27.840
I only know this because Bob Barker was trending and I was like, no, not Bob Barker.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.640
And it was people being glad that it wasn't Bob Barker.

01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:33.200
Oh, Jerry Springer.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:34.400
Okay.

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:35.520
Yeah, it was Jerry Springer.

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.760
I was going to say that would make me feel really bad for who it was.

01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.160
But then.

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:44.320
Um, wow, I think that's a too soon right there.

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:50.400
I can't say I was a fan of the man's work necessarily, but I don't know him personally at all.

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.160
That was probably too far.

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.800
I'm not going to start talking and get you out of this.

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:08.640
I can.

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.000
Let's start talking about Twitter.

01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:12.560
Linus is getting a cosmetic procedure.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.000
Yeah.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:14.720
So.

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:15.120
What?

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:15.600
Why?

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:16.240
Where?

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:18.480
I, I'm going to get microneedling.

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:19.840
What is that?

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:28.080
It's where they take a needle and they stab your face over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:29.360
Wow.

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.880
Many, many, many, many times.

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:34.000
It's like getting a tattoo, but there's no ink, essentially.

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.360
Okay.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:39.360
Yeah. So the idea is that it basically like.

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:41.520
Scars you.

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:42.240
Destroys.

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.120
No, no, it doesn't.

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:44.160
Super small needle.

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:53.200
It basically like destroys all the, the very top layer of tissue or like skin on your face and it promotes collagen production.

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:54.800
Like a recycling thing, basically.

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:55.440
Yeah, pretty much.

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:55.760
Yeah.

01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:00.320
Yeah, just so it's not, it's, you know what's interesting is I was.

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.240
Are you awake for this?

01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:03.040
Oh, yeah.

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:04.320
There's like a numbing cream.

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.440
So hopefully that'll help.

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:06.640
Yeah, it's small.

01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:07.680
It doesn't sound comfortable.

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.000
I've had my, I've had a lot of issues all over the place.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.640
So they put a whole ton of needles in my quad once.

01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:17.040
Oh, yeah.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:22.720
And my, my quad spasmed because of it, which is something they told me that could happen.

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:26.880
Okay.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:28.400
All right.

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:32.800
My quad spasmed and I bent all of the needles like sick.

01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:34.080
Oh yeah, you've told me about that.

01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:34.560
That's hilarious.

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:36.000
Yeah, that was really brutal.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.920
Is it possible that like your cheek could go and it like bends needles in your face?

01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:40.400
I doubt it.

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.200
I don't see why it would.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.120
Do they leave them in or are they just going?

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.880
No, it's like, it's like, it's more like a tattoo.

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.920
Like a sewing machine.

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:46.800
Yeah, okay.

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:58.800
So I was actually like, I was pretty, I was pretty anti any kind of rejuvenating procedure until it was actually David here that I was having a conversation with.

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:03.440
I'll always remember this because it was on this whirlwind trip to Germany that we took where we were there and back.

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:10.080
And like, if it was, if it was more than 48 hours, it wasn't by much and that's a long flight.

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.680
And that included shooting a video.

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:16.880
It was, it was a tough trip, but we did manage to get out and just kind of hang out for a little bit.

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:21.040
And he presented me with a viewpoint that I hadn't really considered before.

01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:25.920
And he was like, yeah, I'm not super into like, like altering your appearance dynamically,

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:28.240
but I don't see anything wrong with maintenance.

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:31.600
In much the same way that you might put a fresh coat of paint on your house.

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:35.680
If it's looking dilapidated, I don't see anything wrong with putting a fresh coat of paint on your body.

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:36.800
And I was like, okay.

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:42.800
So all it does is it stimulates the body's natural collagen production that lowers as you age.

01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:48.400
So it'll, it helps to reduce wrinkles and just kind of generally rejuvenates your skin.

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.080
So I'm like, you know what?

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:52.560
All right, I'll give you a shot.

01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:53.280
I don't see why not.

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:55.200
It's like a few hundred bucks, I think.

01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.040
I'll let you know.

01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:57.520
Okay.

01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.120
Yeah, it's probably going to be very painful.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:00.560
Yeah.

01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:03.600
Well, I mean, yeah, depends how good the numbing cream is,

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:06.880
but like getting a tattoo on your face sounds like it would suck.

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:07.840
Oh, yeah, for sure.

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:10.800
I mean, well, if Darth Maul can do it, then all I have to do is channel the

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:13.440
dark side of the forest and I should be fine.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.200
You should like, you should troll your kids that way.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.240
Like tell them you're going to get this thing done and then come back with like a, like a face paint.

01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.080
Darth Maul face paint.

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.400
Yeah, I don't think I'll need it.

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:28.400
Oh, God.

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:29.360
Face will be quite red.

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:30.000
You look really red.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:30.640
That makes sense.

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:31.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.240
I'll be really irritated.

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.160
That makes sense.

01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:40.240
Is this new news for LTS?

01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.080
This looks like a lot of new news.

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:42.800
Wow.

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:44.800
Oh, are we like officially announcing all the booths?

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:45.760
This is cool.

01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.800
Yeah, let's talk about it.

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:47.120
Sure.

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:47.520
Okay.

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:51.120
LTX 2023 brought to you by ASUS ROG.

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:53.520
I don't know if that was announced before, but that's a thing now.

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:59.680
For creators, we have a bunch more creators confirming their attendance to LTX 2023.

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:03.200
I can bring it up, but I feel like you probably should.

01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:10.080
If any other creators are interested and are currently hearing about LTX and want to attend,

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:15.120
reach out to info at LTXExpo.com.

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:16.720
Here's our creators page.

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:19.040
There's a bunch.

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:23.040
We have a pretty big creator budget this year.

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:25.360
See any big names?

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:25.680
Yeah, you do.

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:27.120
I see a lot of names.

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:27.280
Yeah, you do.

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:28.400
And a bunch of them are big.

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.040
Yeah, you do.

01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:31.440
Yeah, you do.

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:32.160
Heck, yeah.

01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:33.760
Is this freaking awesome or what?

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.920
I'm just excited to meet up with a bunch of these people.

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.720
I know, right?

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.800
A bunch of these people I want to meet for the first time

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.600
and a bunch of them I haven't seen in years because I haven't been out.

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:42.880
Yeah, is this sick or what?

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:43.520
Yeah, it's awesome.

01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:44.160
Yeah.

01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.280
Oh, I'm super excited.

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:46.160
It's going to be awesome.

01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:48.560
Other than meeting very cool creators,

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:49.920
there's a bunch of other things you can do.

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:53.040
There's booths for a 3D printing workshop,

01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:55.520
a build your own screwdriver with like different colors

01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:56.400
and all this kind of stuff,

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:59.600
a SIM racing setup with four to eight rigs.

01:53:59.600 --> 01:53:59.840
Wow.

01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:04.240
An NZXT case toss with three lanes.

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:05.440
Yeah, three lane case stuff.

01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:06.560
The line was so long.

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:06.800
It was.

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:08.400
And we're going to have more people this year.

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:13.840
I think we have almost as many tickets sold now as we did last time,

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:15.840
but wait for it.

01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:20.160
We haven't published a main channel video announcing it yet.

01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:21.760
Oh, whoa.

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:22.960
Yeah.

01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:24.000
We definitely did last time.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:24.640
Oh, yeah.

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:24.880
Wow.

01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:30.480
It's like people want to get out and hang out and see things and people.

01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:33.600
I've also talked to a bunch of people that are just very excited

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:37.760
because they went last time and it was so good and they want to go again.

01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:40.640
Like there's a lot of hype of like, we could finally do it.

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:47.040
I got there's an Epic Games collaboration with PC building simulator two.

01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:50.080
They sponsored a water cooling workshop.

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:50.960
Super cool.

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:53.600
Google Pixel will be sponsoring the meet and greet area.

01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:54.400
Neat.

01:54:54.960 --> 01:55:02.320
MSI, Keoxia, the gaming stadium, London Drugs, DD Mike's and Ridge Wallet,

01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:06.320
and Silverstone, and more are coming on board to be sponsors of the event.

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.240
Whale PCs.

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:12.000
We announced on Twitter that StarForge Systems will be building our Whale PCs

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.480
and LTX merch reservations.

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:17.600
Reserve merch for pickup during the expo.

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:18.160
Oh, yeah.

01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:20.800
So here is what it all looks like.

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:24.880
The sweater and the shirt are so sick.

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:25.200
Yeah.

01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:26.880
They're so cool.

01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:29.360
I'm pretty stoked.

01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:31.920
Now, there is a way.

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:37.040
We talked about this before where we had said that LTX exclusive merch.

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.920
So this stuff was not going to be available online.

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:49.920
We have found a way that maintains the integrity of the exclusivity of event merch.

01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:52.400
But also makes it available online.

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:55.360
So what we've done is we've created a digital pass.

01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:59.920
And it's as simple as subscribing on Floatplane at the $10 tier.

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:05.360
So if you're subscribed on Floatplane, you'll get a whole bunch of content from the event.

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:09.200
So all the panels, any of the games that we play on stage.

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:12.800
We're going to have our social team, which is like three or four people now.

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:14.080
Yeah, they do a great job.

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:15.760
Yeah, they do a great job.

01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:21.680
They're going to be running around filming stuff, basically just going straight from SD card

01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:23.920
to Floatplane, throw a title on it.

01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:29.280
They're going to their directive is upload.

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:30.400
Pump content.

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:32.240
Upload, no delay.

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:37.280
Go shoot something, walk back to the computer, press upload, title it,

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:39.120
walk away and shoot something else.

01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:39.920
Like, let's go.

01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:46.320
So all of that will be going to the $10 tier, all that LTX content.

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:50.480
Some of it may be available at the $5 tier.

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:54.640
I think live streams, we have no way of differentiating right now.

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:57.200
It's just not a feature that the platform supports.

01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:00.160
So if we were to do anything live, that might be available.

01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:04.720
And we might do, you know, maybe a more produced summary video or behind the scenes or something

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:07.520
like that that's available to all Floatplane subscribers.

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:11.360
But what we're going to be doing is we're going to be treating the Floatplane digital

01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:18.560
pass as the $10 tier and the $10 tier will include the LTX digital pass.

01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:27.840
We thought about just doing it as a one-time digital ticket, but the reality of it is that

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.320
that would be development work.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.400
This is too, but this is more useful for other things and kind of scales and stuff like that.

01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:40.160
Yeah, so this makes a lot more sense.

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.600
And for those of you who are upset and worried that this is going to be a cash grab or whatever

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.760
else, you could just subscribe for the one month.

01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:49.520
Like, that's fine.

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:50.400
I don't care.

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.320
Like, do whatever works for you.

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:54.960
So then if you're not subscribed at all, it's $10.

01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:58.720
And if you're subscribed at a different tier, like if you're at the $3 OG tier, for example,

01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:00.400
it's $7.

01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:02.800
And then if you're an OG once, you're an OG forever.

01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.160
So you can always downgrade back to your $3 tier.

01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:07.760
So yeah.

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.160
Hey, there you go.

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:10.720
Right?

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:10.960
Cool.

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:12.640
Not too bad.

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:13.360
Not too bad.

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:20.000
Your OG can theoretically rot if you unsubscribe and cancel your subscription entirely for a

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.360
significant period of time.

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.080
Oh, really?

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:22.880
Theoretically.

01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:23.600
Oh, okay.

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.480
If people email customer support, we usually just honor it anyways.

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:31.280
Well, that's because customer support here has the make it right directive.

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:31.680
Yeah.

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:32.160
So like...

01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:32.880
Trust me, bro.

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:33.360
It's fine.

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:37.920
But it doesn't go away if you like move your subscription to your round.

01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:39.360
Like your flag is...

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:42.560
I love all the people that are looking at stuff we've done lately and been like,

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:48.800
yeah, I think with the things that LMG and the store and everything I've been doing lately,

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:54.240
I think that they can say, trust me, bro, now it was never different.

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:56.400
It was always the same.

01:58:57.680 --> 01:58:58.080
Yeah.

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:02.480
We were just sitting in a very potential energy state with a bunch of things not released yet

01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:04.640
and stuff like that, but it doesn't mean that things changed.

01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:05.520
Nothing changed.

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:11.360
Oh, people are asking, what if they paid for the year?

01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:12.000
I just saw that.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:12.880
That is complicated.

01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:17.120
Luke, we'll figure that out and get back to you.

01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:17.440
Sick.

01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:18.800
Ha, got him.

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:22.160
I can't pick up my phone or else I'll buzz the stream.

01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:25.360
Can you schedule a message for me on Monday?

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.360
Dan, I bought that if you were paying attention.

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:28.800
Thank you.

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:30.400
Huh.

01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:31.120
Yeah, that's a...

01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:32.880
That is complicated.

01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:33.600
Really good question.

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:38.720
Could we just issue a partial refund like prorated and then they could sign up for an annual?

01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:39.760
I'm not committing to anything.

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:40.640
We'll figure something out.

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:41.280
All right, cool.

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:45.120
Yeah, because the accounting department's going to have to sign off on whatever it is we do.

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:46.560
Oh, man.

01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:53.120
Let me tell you, figuring out how to handle being able to take Canadian cash at the event

01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:59.840
and multiple currencies for pre-orders or for reservations,

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:05.520
I've been very challenging, very, very challenging.

02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:12.320
Because the last thing we want to do is create a situation where as exchange rates fluctuate

02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:19.280
in the months leading up to the event, people who reserve before paid more or something compared to

02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:24.800
when they get there, but if we peg it now, how do we avoid that?

02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:30.320
How do we do the accounting for these fluctuations?

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:34.080
If we took the money then, but then the value of that money changed

02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:38.000
by X amount between now and then, it's really bad.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:38.720
It's really dumb.

02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:41.360
Cool.

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:46.000
Anyway, this is the LTX exclusive merch.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.240
We've got the three designer series desk pads, all of which look amazing.

02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:52.720
I think the toughest decision here is which two to buy.

02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:58.960
Then, yeah, we've got the tie-dye shirt, the tie-dye hoodie, the flag.

02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:01.520
The idea with the flag is that it's not huge.

02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:07.120
It's more for carrying around and writing messages on friends that you meet there.

02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:09.040
Really cool thing to get signed.

02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:09.840
Yes, exactly.

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:11.920
Then we've got the gradient enamel pin.

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:14.720
Yeah, because these shirts aren't super signable.

02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:15.600
No, not really.

02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:18.160
Whereas some previous year ones with a silver sharpie were.

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:19.680
Yeah, that makes sense.

02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:23.680
I've got people in Twitch chat, good old Twitch chat.

02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:25.280
The fluctuations wouldn't be that big.

02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:27.120
Yes, they would.

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:28.000
What fluctuations?

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:29.360
Between the USD and CAD.

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:34.000
Yeah, traditionally, no, you're right.

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:35.120
Lately.

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:40.800
Lately, I might still have a tab open with it because I've been watching it really closely lately.

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:54.320
Yeah, in the last one month, it's gone from $1.36, all the way down to almost $1.33,

02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:56.080
all the way up to $1.37.

02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:00.080
That's huge.

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:00.560
Massive.

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:05.680
In business terms, like three or four cents on the dollar over a span of a couple of weeks,

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.880
how on earth are you supposed to plan around that?

02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:10.800
It's wild.

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:16.080
Trying to hire people that want to work remote in other currencies.

02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:16.880
Oh yeah, cool.

02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:19.200
And negotiate trying to figure out wages and stuff.

02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:19.760
It's a nightmare.

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.240
Absolute nightmare.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.200
Anyways, that's LTX.

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:26.560
It's coming soon, super excited.

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:28.800
Genuinely super excited.

02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:32.240
What else do we want to talk about?

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:33.920
Oh, we're supposed to do three merge messages.

02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:34.720
Dan, hit me.

02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:37.120
Second here.

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:40.240
Segway was too fast for me.

02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:43.920
My level back up, there we are.

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:49.760
Hey, DLL, what are your thoughts on cheaper versus more expensive motherboard chipsets?

02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:54.480
Is it worth spending more on a high-end or low-end chipsets enough for most people?

02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:57.360
Chipset?

02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:59.120
That's really going to depend on your use case.

02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:03.280
Yeah, it used to matter a lot more because vendors would lock important features.

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:04.880
Like SLI, for example.

02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:08.720
You could only run two GPUs on a more expensive chipset.

02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:11.280
Not because of any reason other than that.

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:15.120
Well, if you can afford two GPUs, you can afford a more expensive motherboard.

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:16.080
Go fuck yourself, right?

02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:17.520
That was it.

02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:19.040
That was the entire rationale, right?

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:26.320
These days, though, man, the first time I saw a B-series gaming motherboard,

02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:29.040
almost 10 years ago now, I think.

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:29.840
I was like, really?

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:34.320
Because the difference in price was not that much between an entry-level,

02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:38.960
I guess it would have been P-series at the time, or had we moved on to Z yet for performance?

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:39.440
I'm not sure.

02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:45.280
But between the entry-level performance tier chipset boards and this high-end B,

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:48.480
which used to mean business, I think, if I recall correctly,

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.360
and this high-end business chipset board, it was like five bucks or something like that.

02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:59.840
I'm going, well, just get the performance tier board and then get unlocked over clocking,

02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:03.200
which mattered back then because you could actually get more performance out of your chips

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:05.280
because they weren't redlined out of the factory.

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:09.600
But these days, frankly, if I was spending my own money,

02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:13.120
I can't think of any reason that I would go with a higher tier chipset.

02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:16.080
Like, yeah, you get more like USB ports or whatever,

02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:20.000
but when's the last time that you were limited by the number of USB ports on your motherboard?

02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:26.800
Remember, USB hubs are available for as little as six dollars.

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:28.000
Yeah.

02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:32.960
I don't like them.

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:34.560
Sure.

02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:37.840
Do you like running a cable farther down to your computer?

02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:38.480
Use charging and stuff.

02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:40.240
Oh, come on.

02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:42.640
You're not charging devices off your computer.

02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:44.480
I do, sometimes.

02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:44.960
My phone.

02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:49.360
Okay, then use the front USB port on your case.

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:50.000
That's gross.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:50.880
I don't want to do that.

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:55.440
Front USB ports are just for flash drives, other temporarily plugged in things.

02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:58.880
It's hilarious that you guys call me out of touch.

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:01.280
What the hell is that, Luke?

02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:02.320
What is what?

02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:08.400
I have a USB extension multi-port thingy as well.

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:13.760
I would just go basic, especially on AMD, where there's no overclocking locks

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:16.640
and you can do whatever you want, even with the low end stuff.

02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:21.600
The only difference is PCIe lanes, which it's like, okay, yeah.

02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:23.600
How many NVMe drives do you actually need?

02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:27.520
And then we'll see the other difference.

02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:32.000
Yeah, like more USB ports, which I don't need, unless there's a particular feature

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.280
that's only really present on high end boards that I do need.

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:40.640
So one of the things that I use a lot is Thunderbolt because I use optical cables to run my system

02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:44.320
in various parts of my house that I have conduit running to and I have optical Thunderbolt cables.

02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:46.400
I know where you're going with this.

02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:47.200
Just stop.

02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:53.680
The point is, if there's a particular feature that only happens to be present on high end

02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:56.800
chipset boards, then yeah, I guess by all means, spring for it.

02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:58.960
But otherwise, no, there's no real reason to do that.

02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:02.080


02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:04.160
She did ****, Luke.

02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:09.520
Worst takes.

02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:12.240
I got one here for Luke.

02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:13.280
This is from Steve.

02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:17.760
Luke, if you had the opportunity to use your development team for another company's

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:23.360
product or project, which would possibly take time away from Floatplane, but would provide

02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:25.520
a bunch of revenue, would you do it?

02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:28.480
I mean, he does it every day.

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:30.400
They don't only work on Floatplane.com.

02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:30.640
Yeah.

02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:34.640
It's more of like an internal development team at this point.

02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:35.680
It's like amazing.

02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:40.080
Yeah, the company that is Floatplane does a lot of different things.

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:41.440
A ton of different things.

02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:46.480
We have considered being a dev house for outside companies before.

02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:48.000
This was a long time ago.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:56.240
And it's a hard sell just because we have so many internal opportunities to work on

02:06:56.240 --> 02:07:01.040
things, to make things better, to expand what we do in general.

02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:08.000
Like there's so much that we have to do in-house that it hasn't made a lot of sense to like

02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:13.440
share with an outside company, if you know what I mean.

02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:17.280
Is it possible?

02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:23.600
Sure, but the way that we would probably do it instead is just make a tool and then sell

02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:26.320
or make that tool available for a subscription or whatever.

02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:28.880
Whatever type of thing makes sense for whatever type of tool it is,

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.960
probably wouldn't do contract work for an outside company.

02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:37.280
That is a thing that dev houses do and they're very good at it.

02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:38.640
That's great.

02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:40.960
It probably doesn't make sense for us.

02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:46.000
Speaking of Floatplane, there's an exclusive that went up today.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.640
And I'm not going to name any names and I'm not going to watch this video,

02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:53.680
but at least one of these people is probably at least a little spicy.

02:07:56.800 --> 02:07:59.920
We're posting the full interviews for the what's it like to work at Linus.

02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:02.480
You read the comments or something?

02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:03.920
Or just know the person?

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:05.520
No, I just know all these people.

02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:12.000
And I'm just very sure that at least one of them will be a little spicy.

02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:18.080
For those wondering, that's Maria, one of our graphic designers.

02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:19.600
Riley, who I think you know.

02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:20.720
He runs TechLinked.

02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:22.640
And have we announced GameLinked yet?

02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:27.520
Well, soon he'll be managing the Linqt team in general.

02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:32.640
That's Sarah, the one and only Ms. Butt, also one of our graphic designers.

02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:33.760
And that's Tim from the lab.

02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:39.520
Okay, here comes another one.

02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:46.880
With Luke calling companies and organizing, spinning up their own LLMs,

02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:53.040
will smaller companies that collect training data and create custom AIs become a new space for startups?

02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:01.040
Can you rephrase the end of that?

02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:03.040
Okay, he's basically asking,

02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:10.560
is companies that aggregate data and then create these highly customized large language models

02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:12.400
going to be a new space for startups?

02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:17.040
Oh, yes, and it's already happening.

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:22.000
I mean, what's really interesting is OpenAI CEO came out very recently and said,

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.320
look, the next frontier is not going to be just building bigger models.

02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:29.920
Yeah, it's going to be it's going to be building better models.

02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:32.720
And I think you've basically hit the nail on the head.

02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:40.320
I don't need a generalized model that was trained on a quadrillion data points necessarily.

02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:45.920
But you might need like one model that because a huge problem that we're running into is licensing

02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:47.440
of data and information.

02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:53.360
So a lot of what LLMs are currently trained on right now include things like pirated books

02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:58.000
and other things that like clearly they should not have access to.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.680
And then there's things that like is maybe a little bit of a gray area,

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:04.800
like Reddit posts and Stack Overflow things and stuff like that,

02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:11.120
which is currently going through the the ever churning process of capitalism to figure out

02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:17.440
how those companies can try to charge OpenAI for that access or however that's going to go.

02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:24.160
So the data set that these things are able to train off in the future is going to be interesting

02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:25.840
and is going to potentially change.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:30.880
The current data sets that are out there are out there because they're open source and

02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:33.280
downloadable Wild West, maybe people have them.

02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:36.640
You can't take it back at this point, but moving forward, it could change.

02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:41.280
And there is absolutely space and this is currently happening for say a medical model

02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:46.160
that is trained from textbooks or papers from certain publishers.

02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:49.040
And they have agreements with those publishers in order to have that data.

02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:54.080
And it is trained on all that information for helping to educate medical students

02:10:54.080 --> 02:11:00.160
all the way up to helping to inform and drive medical science and medical practice at hospitals

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:03.200
and universities and everything that is currently happening.

02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:07.360
So making LLMs that are grounded in one specific space is totally going to be a thing

02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:11.440
and is literally already a thing to a certain degree.

02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:14.240
So yeah, awesome.

02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:17.120
Okay, let's head on to some rapid fire.

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:18.560
Holy crap.

02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:21.200
I didn't even realize this.

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:25.360
But the game linked branding is up.

02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:30.560
Oh, it looks pretty good.

02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:33.520
Yeah, we haven't.

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:36.160
Yeah, we haven't announced anything yet.

02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:40.720
Apparently people are like, you know, and it's casually just like leaked an upcoming channel.

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:41.600
Yeah.

02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:43.520
So we talked about it before we have.

02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:44.000
We have.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:44.400
We have.

02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:44.880
Oh, okay.

02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:45.520
Yeah, there you go.

02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:46.320
So briefly.

02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:49.680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we got it.

02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:50.800
We got this moment.

02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:52.640
Nice.

02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:01.680
You think it'll have a 100,000 subscriber plaque before it releases a video?

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:02.560
That'd be kind of fun.

02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.320
Should we try and do that?

02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:06.720
I mean, I'm down.

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:07.920
Guaranteed success.

02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:12.160
It's not that I want to take on jack sucks at life or like, you know, play button collection

02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:12.720
or whatever.

02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:16.320
But like, I mean, I'm always I'm always down for another play button for the wall.

02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:17.760
Yeah.

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:20.080
Someone someone asked me the other day, like,

02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:24.880
man, no, no, it wasn't me.

02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:25.680
It was someone else.

02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:28.080
But I was I was showing my my play button wall.

02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:30.640
We were we were shooting at at my house.

02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.720
Oh, we shot Yvonne's aim, the ultimate tech upgrade this week.

02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:35.040
Yeah.

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:38.960
So one of one of the crew that was there helping with the shoot was like, oh, yeah,

02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:42.560
you know, her space looks so nice now and so cohesive.

02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:44.960
And yours just has all those play buttons on that one wall.

02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:46.640
Are you going to put anything on this wall?

02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:49.600
And I'm like, yeah, more play buttons.

02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:53.040
Let's go.

02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:57.040
Apparently it's past a thousand already.

02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:57.520
That makes sense.

02:12:58.160 --> 02:12:59.360
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:01.280
Now we just have to do that a hundred times.

02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:03.520
See, look how easy it is to get a hundred thousand subscribers.

02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:04.240
Yeah, no problem.

02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:05.680
Just do that, then do it a hundred times.

02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:07.920
And then if you want to get a million, well, you just do that 10 more times.

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.720
And if you want 10 million, we'll do it 10 more times.

02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:11.280
Easy.

02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:12.000
Yeah.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.280
I don't know why people think it's so hard.

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:14.640
Slash s slash s.

02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:15.680
We just relax all day.

02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:18.480
It's very easy.

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:19.520
There's no stress here.

02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:20.720
I'm OK.

02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:22.400
Everything's fine.

02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:26.080
The carpet isn't for like laying down when you're completely stressed out and need to

02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:30.000
thank the carpets for just taking naps because that's all that's like half of what people do.

02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:31.680
It's good for crying as well.

02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:32.240
Just take a break.

02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:33.360
Yeah, OK.

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:35.920
OK, rapid fire.

02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:36.400
Come on.

02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:37.600
OK, I will rapid fire.

02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:38.560
You better.

02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:42.320
Luke and Linus have given an unlimited budget and only allowed to purchase one single item.

02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:42.960
What would you buy?

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.320
It's a really hard one to think about immediately.

02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:48.400
The biggest piece of gold.

02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:52.160
That is a very reasonable answer, actually.

02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:53.520
I'm going to say the same thing.

02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:54.960
The biggest satchel of money.

02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:55.760
Yeah.

02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:58.080
Something that's a good investment.

02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:01.120
Not something that depreciates.

02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:02.240
Google.

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:05.520
OK, that's a good answer.

02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:06.320
Microsoft.

02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:07.440
Microsoft, yeah.

02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:08.400
That's a better answer.

02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:08.960
I'm going to pivot.

02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:10.800
I don't know, dude.

02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:11.440
OK, next.

02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:14.240
When is part two of the ultimate gaming mini van coming out?

02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:15.360
Never.

02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:17.920
No, no, no.

02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:19.120
No, we're going to look.

02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:21.600
If I'm going to have those stupid solar panels on my roof.

02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:22.720
It does look goofy.

02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:28.160
And I can, I can, I can hear them when I'm on the highway.

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:31.040
Like it's not very aerodynamic anymore.

02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:31.680
Then darn it.

02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:36.880
I'm going to have that like battery system and I'm going to have those gaming machines.

02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:41.600
Never mind that my kids all every single one of them get really bad motion sickness

02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:43.280
and probably won't even be able to use it.

02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:44.160
I want a gaming.

02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:47.600
You can play when we're parked.

02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:49.280
Yeah, yeah.

02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:53.280
Part two of the NCIX PC is also coming eventually.

02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:56.320
I think they're making more progress on that one than on the gaming mini van.

02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:57.280
Part two pizza heater.

02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:00.960
No gaming pizza of it.

02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:08.560
Hey Linus and Luke, what is your opinion on interplanetary file system or IPFS as a solution

02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:10.640
to the centralized internet model?

02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:11.680
Have you ever heard of this?

02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:15.600
No, it's it.

02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:17.120
Yeah, sorry me either.

02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:17.840
I guess I suck.

02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:19.840
Okay, next.

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:22.560
Since Linus has said before that he rides a motorcycle.

02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:26.080
Have you ever considered making a jacket specifically for riding or even a normal

02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:29.360
jacket with slots for slide in attachment of riding armor?

02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:30.000
No, it's hard.

02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:34.720
How would you navigate finding an investor or pitch to a company for an organic

02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:37.120
groundbreaking chip and computational method?

02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:40.640
Sim testing better than anything we have today power and performance wise.

02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:42.000
That was a good pitch.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.280
That sounds like a pitch to me.

02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:44.640
Seed investment round incoming.

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:46.720
Seed investment, I get it.

02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:49.680
Because it's an organic chip.

02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:53.120
What April Fool's Day video is the most fun to...

02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:54.080
He also said groundbreaking.

02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:55.680
Planner shoot.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:02.720
I don't know.

02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:04.560
They're all so epic and amazing.

02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:07.040
I actually, I love, I love April Fool's.

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:07.920
It's my favorite thing.

02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:11.440
Truth about Linus tech tips exposed.

02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:16.560
I, I unironically really enjoyed when you just threw the computer case outside and

02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:19.440
then we just left the camera on it for like seven minutes or whatever.

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:21.760
I thought that was hilarious.

02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:26.160
I know my sense of humor doesn't necessarily align with everyone's.

02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:27.520
But I thought it was great.

02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:29.680
Referring to, why is this so hard to, yeah.

02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:32.160
This was like 2013 April Fool's or something.

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:32.960
Yeah, here it is.

02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:33.840
Here's the playlist.

02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:38.720
Okay, so the joke here, love that twitch shirt.

02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:42.240
Just filming on the street at the old Blaminghouse is amazing.

02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:43.680
Good production values.

02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:49.840
The joke here is that that case, I accidentally unboxed it twice.

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:54.480
So it was, it was on the market and relevant for so long.

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:57.520
That literally made two videos without realizing it.

02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:01.520
I made a video about it twice, doing exactly the same thing,

02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:04.000
like unboxing and kind of giving an overview of it.

02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:10.000
So what I decided to do, because we just had one kicking around for some reason,

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.120
maybe for a build or something.

02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:12.720
I don't remember why we had it.

02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:16.560
But I was like, haha, wouldn't it be funny if I was like,

02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:20.480
Lola, we're going to unbox this case and we do it a third time.

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:26.320
So the video is 13 minutes long, which would have been a pretty typical length for us to kind of

02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:28.560
sucker people into thinking that it's a real video.

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:32.560
And then we get as far as taking it out of the box.

02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:40.000
And then wait for it, wait for it.

02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:42.800
It's a Linus classic moment.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.520
That was on purpose, by the way.

02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:54.640
You can tell because I'm a very bad actor.

02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:58.160
Not as bad as Luke, but very bad.

02:17:58.160 --> 02:17:58.640
It's true.

02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:06.640
And then, and now we play the waiting game.

02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:14.640
We just filled the case in the rain for like 10 minutes or something.

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:19.120
And people, a bunch of people like hated this.

02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:21.040
I thought it was so funny.

02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:24.160
I loved this so much.

02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:27.280
It's literally just the worst of the video.

02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:32.080
So the thing that is amazing.

02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:32.800
That's art.

02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:33.200
Yeah.

02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:38.400
So the thing is, this timeline thumbnail feature didn't exist then.

02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:40.320
Yeah.

02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:40.560
Yeah.

02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:40.720
Yeah.

02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:41.360
Yeah.

02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:42.560
So people would watch.

02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:45.520
Yeah.

02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:47.520
To say that people weren't that thrilled.

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:50.400
Yeah.

02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:53.920
People didn't really like it, but it's like actually one of my favorite ones,

02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:57.200
just because I just my sense of humor just really enjoys that.

02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:00.560
Um, okay.

02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:01.520
So hold on a second.

02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:03.440
Where, wait, where'd that playlist go?

02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:05.280
Oh, seriously?

02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:09.200
How is this navigation so bad?

02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:09.920
I clicked on it.

02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:10.080
Okay.

02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:10.320
Yeah.

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:11.120
Here it is.

02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:12.160
So here's the playlist.

02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:13.920
Oh, okay.

02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:13.920


02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:14.720
No.

02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:15.840
The playlist was two down.

02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:17.920
Oh, dang it.

02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:19.520
I can't see my screen.

02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:20.800
This mic is in front of it.

02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:21.120
Okay.

02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:22.240
Here it is.

02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:22.480
There.

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:22.880
Yeah.

02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:23.440
Playlist.

02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:24.640
Okay.

02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:24.960
Pause.

02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:25.920
Oh, okay.

02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:26.960
This is what I was supposed to do.

02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:28.240
I blame the user.

02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:29.200
PEPCAC.

02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:29.520
Okay.

02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:30.400
2016.

02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:33.920
That was when we made the video claiming we'd been bought out by NVIDIA.

02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:37.920
The number of people that believed that in terms of believability,

02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:42.720
I think this might have been the strongest one because it was a completely straight face

02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:47.040
delivery of something that I don't know on the surface of it could kind of make sense.

02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:51.360
NVIDIA wanting a media company as part of their portfolio or something.

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:53.040
And the number of people.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:03.120
So part of our April Fools planning is that I tend to lean into some kind of conversation

02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:03.840
or some kind of-

02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:05.280
They're topical to a certain degree.

02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:06.240
Perception.

02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:12.800
And at that time, one of the big narratives that existed for whatever reason was that

02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:17.440
I had my lips wrapped firmly around NVIDIA's throbbing ego.

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:22.480
And so I basically went, okay, well, given that people believe this anyway,

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:27.760
why don't we give them what they want and claim that we've been outright purchased by NVIDIA?

02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:31.600
And so the number of people that believe this one was probably the highest out of any.

02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:34.960
The following year, this one did pretty well.

02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:37.040
This didn't take a lot of planning.

02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:37.920
I just like wrote it up.

02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:38.960
It's only a two minute video.

02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:39.600
It was pretty quick.

02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:40.800
This one took no planning.

02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:42.480
So you asked which one was the most fun to plan?

02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:47.440
This one was really fun to plan because it involved pyrotechnics, which I always love.

02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:49.200
That was real fire in the video.

02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:55.600
Man, the number of comments insulting our VFX, talking about what a poor job we did of the fake

02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:58.800
fire, it's like, take off your tinfoil hat.

02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:00.240
It's literally real fire.

02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:02.480
You ain't as cool as you think you are.

02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:04.240
That is actual fire.

02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:07.040
And it's not like we did anything really weird or complicated.

02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:13.200
We just took a can of hairspray and just lit it and blew it through the great in the door.

02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:14.640
You're not clever.

02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:17.360
You're not seeing through the-

02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:21.600
That's like someone who's seen too much VFX?

02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:22.240
Yeah, maybe.

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:23.920
And not enough actual real fire?

02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:24.640
Yeah, I guess so.

02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:26.800
And we're like, wait, this doesn't look like my VFX.

02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:28.400
That's bad.

02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:29.840
It must be bad VFX.

02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:31.120
No, it's just fire.

02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:31.920
Chill out.

02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:38.240
The fire pull one was kind of fun, but very last minute, the execution was not that great.

02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:40.560
I think that's probably my least favorite.

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:43.440
You and I actually went down it.

02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:44.640
You know what?

02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:46.560
This is my favorite.

02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:49.200
The concrete cooled PC.

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:50.160
That was pretty sick.

02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:53.120
I didn't get to be as involved in the planning of this one.

02:21:54.960 --> 02:22:03.920
I love the OnlyFans one, but I think the concrete PC was my favorite because that was one that I pushed hard for.

02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.080
What one do you think is the best?

02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:13.520
Because I think the actual execution and the end result of the product of the we need to talk potato farm was like.

02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:15.120
Outstanding.

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:16.240
Very, very good.

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:18.320
It's definitely the best production value one.

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:24.320
In terms of which one was most profitable, that's got to be this review.

02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:25.600
Get stranger and stranger.

02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:29.120
The never ending segue where every sponsor did pay us for it.

02:22:29.120 --> 02:22:30.400
It's like unbelievable.

02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:37.360
But I still love the concrete cooled PC one because everyone internally was like, this is too stupid.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.120
Nobody will believe this.

02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:44.640
And the number of people that legitimately were like, how'd they do that?

02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:47.280
I'm surprised this worked.

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:50.000
And I've read a lot of comments.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.920
I can tell the difference between the ones who are playing along and the ones that are

02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:56.640
definitely not just playing along.

02:22:56.640 --> 02:23:00.080
A significant number of people believed we cooled a PC with concrete.

02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:02.400
Ask follow up questions.

02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:04.720
We're legitimately curious to learn more about it.

02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:10.720
And we did such a good job of matching the color of the milk to the concrete.

02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:14.240
And the way that we filmed it, the way we filmed it out of order to kind of

02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:18.720
movie magic the whole thing together, I was on set with Alex the whole time filming it.

02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:22.000
And he was telling me the whole time, this is not going to come together.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.400
I'm like, no, I have a vision this time.

02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:25.200
Just trust me.

02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:26.480
Trust me, bro.

02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:29.680
And then at the end, he's like, all right.

02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.280
All right.

02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:33.280
That was pretty sweet.

02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:36.240
Okay, ready for a few more?

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:36.960
Yeah.

02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:39.440
Okay, let's switch back to potential here.

02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:44.080
My family uses iMessage to discuss important info and many of my non-social media friends

02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:45.840
use group text as SM.

02:23:46.800 --> 02:23:50.480
Tips for those who are trapped by Apple stubbornness to use RCS.

02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:53.680
EU-USBC type law for RCS.

02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:54.320
Use signal.

02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:58.240
All right, now he's got to convince his parents to move over too.

02:23:58.720 --> 02:23:58.960
That's...

02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:07.200
I'm getting a little fatigued on the amount of different messaging things that I have

02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:11.440
and needing to remember how every individual person likes to be contacted.

02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:11.600
It's fine.

02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:13.280
Here's my folder of all my messaging apps.

02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:18.560
Yeah, it tires me out a little bit.

02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:21.600
Yeah, here, here, name anyone and I'll tell you where I talk to them.

02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:24.480
Uh, no.

02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:30.800
All right, since you're so close to Alberta and make a decent and fairly priced versions of

02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:34.480
whatever you set your mind to, can we please get an LTT cowboy hat?

02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:37.200
Uh, no.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.480
I should, I should offer it a little bit more.

02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:44.240
I shouldn't just be dismissive.

02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:49.360
The reason that I wouldn't is because I tend to focus our product development efforts on

02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:56.000
things where we are passionate and feel that we have something to contribute.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:56.560
Something to add.

02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:57.600
Yeah, something to contribute to the conversation.

02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:02.640
I think there's a lot of people who are passionate about cowboy hats and make really great cowboy

02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:04.800
hats and power to them.

02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:10.160
We have a store like literally legitimately basically down the street from here that sells

02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:16.800
that kind of stuff, but that's not a thing that we're exactly known for, you know, so yeah.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:18.800
Hey guys, love the show.

02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:19.680
Watch it religiously.

02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:20.640
Question for Luke.

02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:24.880
I am currently, I have two budgies and they provide endless entertainment.

02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:27.680
What are some of your favorite moments as a bird owner?

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:30.560
I was just thinking you put a little knock to a fan in the back.

02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:30.960
There you go.

02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:31.600
That's what you can add.

02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:33.680
Make it out of alpaca fur.

02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:38.160
What is my favorite thing that they do?

02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:40.560
What's your favorite bird memory?

02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:44.160
Favorite bird memory is pretty easy.

02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:45.040
Okay, I'll answer that one.

02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:48.320
Our first bird to keto.

02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:52.400
There was a fire near my apartment.

02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:57.360
Like I don't remember if it was a forest fire or it was another more different fire that I'm not

02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.360
going to specify because I don't want to give away where I'm at.

02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:04.720
But there was a fire that was leaving a lot of smoke in the air.

02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:10.320
And a solution that I came up with was to bring the bird and the cage and everything

02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:15.600
into the bathroom and then run the shower so that there was a little bit of a barrier

02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:18.480
and the moisture in the air and the shower would.

02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:21.440
Yeah, so that was the plan.

02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:23.840
And I didn't know what to do.

02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:27.200
I didn't know if he was going to freak out because he's like,

02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:30.880
had never been into my room, let alone the bathroom attached to it,

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.320
had never been next to a shower, all this type of stuff.

02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:36.960
But I put the cage down, I just lay down next to the cage.

02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:39.840
And I'm just like, I play music that he likes.

02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:42.400
And he was just stoked.

02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:44.480
He was like, oh, sick, we're going to hang out.

02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:45.440
Well, that's cool.

02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:50.160
And he just like played around and sung songs and was just happy and cool about it.

02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:51.920
And that was just, that was a cool moment.

02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:55.120
I tend to, if you listen to me tell stories about anything,

02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:58.480
I tend to enjoy the ones where there's a large conflict

02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:01.120
and we are able to overcome.

02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:01.840
We win.

02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:02.480
Yeah.

02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:03.440
All right.

02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:05.520
Next. Oh, give me one more.

02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:06.560
You want one more?

02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:06.560


02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:07.440
Okay, one more.

02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:10.640
Hi, future me.

02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:12.640
I would love to see a way to listen to the show

02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:15.840
like an audio podcast on float plane for when I am driving.

02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:19.360
Is there some audio podcast that you are listening to on a regular basis?

02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:21.840
Oh, that wasn't where I thought that was going to go.

02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:22.480
Me too.

02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:23.840
That was a statement.

02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:27.200
We could upload an audio form of, for sure, that's possible.

02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:28.400
Can we do that?

02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:30.240
That would just have to be process involved.

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:31.120
Who does that?

02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:32.400
Don't we support audio?

02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:32.960
Yes.

02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:36.800
Yes, but there would be someone would have to, you know, do it.

02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:38.400
But that's like a Linus Media Group process,

02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:40.720
not a float plane process that has to be changed, right?

02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:40.960
Yeah.

02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:45.520
I think there was something on my to-do list to like look at the podcast for like workflow.

02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:47.120
I'll see if I can automate that.

02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:49.840
Okay.

02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:50.320
Typing.

02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:51.840
Okay, cool.

02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:55.280
Because you can also like edit the post afterwards and add it.

02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:56.880
Okay.

02:27:56.880 --> 02:27:58.480
Yeah, it would just do like an auto-generated.

02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:00.880
Why don't we do a topic while you work on that then?

02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:02.480
Okay, I'll get that done by the end of the show.

02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:06.560
UK regulators have blocked the Microsoft Activision Blizzard deal.

02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:10.880
Yeah, which like might be a good thing.

02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:11.360
I don't know.

02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:14.400
I don't know enough about this, but the reason for it was kind of funky.

02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:16.640
Yeah, that doesn't make a ton of sense to me.

02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:17.360
Yeah.

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:18.640
So I'm trying to find this.

02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:20.080
I'll read through it once I find it.

02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:22.320
There it is.

02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:27.600
UK regulators have blocked Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard

02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:31.280
on the grounds that it will reduce competition in cloud gaming,

02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:39.920
which is the competition and markets, which the competition and markets authority sees

02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:42.000
as a low-cost alternative to consoles.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.680
Sure, because it sort of is.

02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:49.360
Microsoft does control around 60 to 70% of the cloud gaming market,

02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:54.400
which is less than 1% of the total global gaming market.

02:28:54.400 --> 02:29:01.280
However, regulators cited estimates that it will grow to around 9% of the market by 2026.

02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:06.400
I haven't seen a ton of things moving that direction to be completely honest.

02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:06.720
Yeah.

02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:10.240
So I don't know where that number is necessarily coming from,

02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:16.720
but 9% would be a lot of the gaming market to be happening over the cloud instead of like

02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:18.000
very major.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.960
That would have a significant impact on web traffic.

02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:21.760
Yeah.

02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:23.760
Like that's genuinely okay.

02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:28.320
That's a big number that I would kind of bet against to be completely honest.

02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:31.680
Again, I don't know if this should happen or not.

02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:32.560
I'm not weighing in on that.

02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:34.400
I just the reasoning seems funky.

02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:41.200
Blizzard has been struggling with ugly labor disputes and their stock prices dropped 11%

02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:42.480
after the announcement was made.

02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:46.400
While Microsoft's own stock rose by 8%, I'm surprised it's honestly that low.

02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:48.240
They've been kind of killing it.

02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:52.560
An Activision spokesperson has said that they will work aggressively with Microsoft

02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:56.960
to appeal the decision and that the UK is clearly closed for business.

02:29:56.960 --> 02:29:58.000
Is that a sex thing?

02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.280
Work aggressively together?

02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:02.160
That sounds like a euphemism.

02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:05.680
I do know this is a...

02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:09.760
Like if I said I was going to work aggressively with you, what would you think of that?

02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:11.520
I mean, I don't doubt.

02:30:11.520 --> 02:30:11.840
HR.

02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:15.440
HR is not needed if there's no problem.

02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:21.520
I do know Blizzard is having a problem right now where they're losing a lot of talent.

02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:29.920
Apparently they hired people during COVID, which were hired with the understanding that

02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:34.240
they were full-time work from home permanently, and then they have called them into work.

02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:40.560
Some of these people were hired, living nowhere even near to Blizzard, and now they need to

02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:44.160
come into work, which there's problems with that because relocating...

02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.920
Yeah, because if they don't live near a Blizzard, they probably don't have snow tires already.

02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:51.040
Relocating your entire family is an issue.

02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:54.720
Now these people might have to live in much higher cost of living areas...

02:30:54.720 --> 02:30:55.840
Higher temperature areas.

02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:06.080
Based on where Blizzard is, it's actually very likely true for where these people are probably

02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:06.560
coming from.

02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:08.320
But yeah, it's an issue.

02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:09.920
So a lot of those people are just saying like, no.

02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:11.760
See ya.

02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:12.960
I quit, I guess.

02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:15.760
That's a really rude hand gesture in some places, but okay.

02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:16.320
Is it?

02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:16.640
Peace?

02:31:17.920 --> 02:31:18.560
This is peace.

02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:21.360
Did you look backwards?

02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:21.760
What is that?

02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:23.040
You didn't show the back of your hand, did you?

02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:25.680
What does it mean?

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:26.320
We gotta blur that.

02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:26.960
Inform me.

02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:27.600
Don't worry about it.

02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:28.000
What is it?

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:28.320
Okay.

02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:30.640
I genuinely don't know.

02:31:32.640 --> 02:31:35.200
Anyways, they're saying peace and then leaving.

02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:41.600
Man, it shouldn't even be allowed for two gestures to be that similar in one of them's

02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:42.560
cool and one of them's not.

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:43.440
That's ridiculous.

02:31:44.240 --> 02:31:46.560
I mean, what was it?

02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:51.440
Okay, and white power being the exact same hand gesture, but just the orientation.

02:31:51.440 --> 02:31:52.640
If you do scuba diving...

02:31:52.640 --> 02:31:53.520
Come on!

02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:55.600
If you do scuba diving, it's like, oh, well...

02:31:57.760 --> 02:32:00.560
I mean, it's so dark, I can't tell what color any of us are down here.

02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:04.080
Oh, man.

02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:08.080
In the UK, the backwards peace site is a middle finger?

02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:08.480
Why?

02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:09.280
I don't...

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:10.400
Anyways, moving on.

02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:13.120
Yeah, so a lot of them are quitting.

02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:16.080
So they're having this huge like brain drain talent issue.

02:32:16.080 --> 02:32:23.280
And it's kind of weird because a lot of actually good things for Blizzard in regards to development,

02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:26.960
getting timelines that are way and roadmaps and all this kind of stuff happened over the

02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:29.360
COVID period with all these people working from home.

02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:29.840
So like...

02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:34.720
I don't know, but yeah.

02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:42.320
Ooh, Colorado confirms farmers' right to repair.

02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:47.840
Colorado is the first state to pass a law guaranteeing farmers the right to repair

02:32:47.840 --> 02:32:49.120
their own equipment.

02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:52.960
Manufacturers will be required to provide parts, embedded software,

02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:58.400
firmware, tools, and any relevant documentation to equipment owners and independent repair

02:32:58.400 --> 02:32:58.960
providers.

02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:04.080
Failing to provide these resources will be considered a deceptive trade practice

02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:05.280
under Colorado law.

02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:13.680
Very good.

02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:14.160
Very good.

02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:18.400
Manufacturers will no longer be allowed to discourage owners from making their own repairs

02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:22.720
or require independent repair providers to undergo any kind of certification to become

02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:24.720
an authorized repair provider.

02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:31.600
So it just has to be, you know, free market and you have to be a good repair provider and

02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:35.440
have a good reputation and business will come and that's how it's supposed to work.

02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:38.880
John Deere stated that the law is unnecessary.

02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:46.160
Oh yeah, and will have unintended consequences for its customers.

02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:48.400
Well yeah, unintended by you.

02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:51.440
We know what your intentions were, you jackasses.

02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:56.960
John Deere is facing a class action lawsuit for alleged monopolization of repair services

02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:59.360
as well as several antitrust lawsuits.

02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:02.000
Now I can't wait for this to come for the McDonald's ice cream machines.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:07.200
Well there's actually like a bunch of, do you know about that?

02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:08.320
Some contract that they have?

02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:09.520
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:15.120
There are currently 15 other states with pending right to repair legislation for farmers

02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:19.840
and Colorado has recently passed another law ensuring the right to repair motorized wheel

02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:20.320
chairs.

02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:20.800
Oh cool.

02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:23.920
Like I'm really thinking about that, but that totally makes sense.

02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.520
Is this finally happening?

02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:27.840
Slowly, but maybe.

02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:32.240
I keep hearing whenever this type of stuff happens, I keep hearing like oh yeah,

02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:33.440
right to repair, win.

02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:35.760
And then a few days later you hear like, uh...

02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:36.640
Yeah, but it's bad.

02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:39.360
Yeah, like in the same bill they snuck in a bunch of stuff.

02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:42.080
This one seems like it might actually be good.

02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:43.920
It seems, yeah.

02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:45.840
Which is really, really exciting.

02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:48.080
Yeah, it's good.

02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:48.880
Yeah, float plane chat.

02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:51.120
All my homies hate monopolies, 100%.

02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:52.160
Exactly.

02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:53.600
Last topic, I think.

02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:56.000
No, I'm bored of that one.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:56.640
Okay.

02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:57.600
I think it's boring.

02:34:57.600 --> 02:34:57.920
All right.

02:34:57.920 --> 02:34:59.680
Let's switch to Wanshow After Dark.

02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:00.320
All right.

02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:01.280
You ready, Dan?

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:06.480
People on LMG Clips are super confused about Wanshow After Dark.

02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:07.520
Because it's really dark sometimes?

02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:09.360
Yeah, because there's just a clip and it's dark.

02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:11.760
Yeah, they don't know about Wanshow After Dark yet.

02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:18.240
So our Wanshow homies who actually watch the show, you know, if you see people confused,

02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:20.960
help point them toward the light or will the dark?

02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:22.000
Yeah.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:23.200
Point them toward the answer.

02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:29.600
Okay.

02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:33.200
How overwhelmed are the message boards today, Dan?

02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:35.120
A little bit overwhelming.

02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:37.760
You did a couple of segments where I had to not be at my desk,

02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:40.720
but I almost got through it and now we're here.

02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:43.200
Wow.

02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:47.120
Towel sales are up 7,867%.

02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:47.840
That makes sense.

02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:49.440
Where does that number come from?

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:50.720
No, seriously, though.

02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:54.240
How do you derive that from 239 units?

02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:59.520
I bet you it's an average over time.

02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:01.760
And we ran out of stock of the other ones, right?

02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:02.160
Yeah.

02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:03.920
So it would have been zero for a very long time.

02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:04.960
So maybe we sold one towel.

02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:06.160
But not zero before then.

02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:07.760
In the last, you know, three months.

02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:09.120
So then it's like point something.

02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:10.000
Yeah.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:10.480
Okay.

02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:10.720
Yeah.

02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:11.360
That makes sense.

02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:13.360
Cool.

02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:16.960
Most popular items today, you didn't ask, but I'm answering it for you.

02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:18.080
Our towels.

02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:20.560
You guys are super into the towels being restocked.

02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:20.880
Do you know what?

02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:24.080
That's probably a combination of also people having, yeah,

02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:25.360
back in stock notifications.

02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:27.040
Screwdriver.

02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:27.840
Always popular.

02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:29.760
Northern Lights t-shirt.

02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:31.680
Yeah, the Northern Lights t-shirt is going to be a killer.

02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:32.560
It's a good design.

02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:37.040
Then a bunch of freebies, animal sticker packs.

02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:39.200
What else we got here?

02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:40.240
Screwdriver bit sets.

02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:43.520
We sell so many more bit sets than I imagined we would.

02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:44.960
I just kind of thought most people would be like,

02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:45.360
yeah, I don't know.

02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:46.000
It's a screwdriver.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.360
I'll just use whatever the bits are coming.

02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:47.600
Nope.

02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:48.560
Nope.

02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:51.360
The attach rate on bit sets is like over 30%.

02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:53.120
I think it's like 40% or something like that.

02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:53.680
Yeah, it's wild.

02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:55.520
Backpacks.

02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:56.480
Oh, right.

02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:58.480
That makes sense because we are doing the promo today.

02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:00.320
Free sequined pillow.

02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:02.640
Is that towel actually white?

02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:04.880
Someone's asking if it's actually white or gray.

02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:06.800
It looks actually white to me.

02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:08.480
I would say that is white.

02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:11.600
I think we should update the color on the site to say actually white.

02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:11.920
Yeah.

02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:13.600
I kind of like that name for a,

02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:15.520
I kind of like that name for a,

02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:18.720
I'm just, you know, a white, you know.

02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:22.560
It's like, it's a great way to describe a Karen, you know.

02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:26.240
All right, Dan, hit me.

02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:28.000
Sure.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.120
Just let me give you a second.

02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:31.680
Okay.

02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:32.160
All right.

02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:35.200
First up, Linus.

02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:39.040
What amounts per month would it take to have YouTube Premium remove all ads,

02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:41.120
both adsense and in-video?

02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:44.720
I'm starting to see videos with 50% ad reads, not LTT.

02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:46.960
YouTube Premium is supposed to get rid of ads.

02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:52.240
Well, it would be irresponsible of me or not irresponsible.

02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:56.400
It would be dishonest of me to not bring up that there is a solution to that problem.

02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:01.760
It doesn't work on every platform, but there's a third party extension called sponsor block

02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:06.400
that will actually remove self-promotion, baked in advertising.

02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:11.280
Obviously, as a content creator, I'm going to give you the other side of that coin.

02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:13.840
You know, I can't speak for everyone else,

02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:17.200
but I will say that we're always trying to find a good balance of

02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:21.360
talking about services we offer like Floatplane,

02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:23.200
talking about the merch on LTT Store,

02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:29.520
talking about the sponsors that help make our production possible.

02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:31.840
Not everyone finds the right balance,

02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:38.400
but they also might be going through harder times than you know, they might need it.

02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:43.280
So as I've said in the past and as I will continue to say,

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:46.240
because nothing other people say about it really changes anything,

02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:50.800
you just you gotta understand what you're doing.

02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:55.360
If that's the price of admission that they set for the content,

02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:59.920
then if you want to consume that content, they're the ones who set the price.

02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:04.320
There's also nothing that they can do to prevent you from just, you know, pressing the arrow key.

02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:07.840
Like that's another really quick way of skipping something if you don't want to watch it.

02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:10.800
No one can force you to watch something that you don't want to watch.

02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:17.440
So yeah, you just gotta, you gotta weigh how much you want to support the creators that you watch.

02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:19.360
And presumably this is creators you watch, right?

02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:21.040
Because otherwise you wouldn't have brought it up with me.

02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:25.440
And how much you are willing to not support them,

02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:28.000
knowing that if you don't support them at some point,

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.840
they could go away or their model could shift

02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:32.880
and they might not be able to make the content that you're apparently enjoying.

02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:36.720
Okay, up next.

02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:39.280
Oh, I didn't actually answer the question.

02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:40.000
Oh, yeah, you're supposed to be that.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.240
What amount would it take per month?

02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:46.640
I think the best way for me to answer that

02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:54.000
is to refer back to our How Does LMG Make Money 2020 update.

02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:57.280
So we've got a breakdown here.

02:39:59.360 --> 02:39:59.840
Here we go.

02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:03.840
Oh, I hate that the preview doesn't take you,

02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:05.760
like see this preview?

02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:07.760
That doesn't take you to before that image.

02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:09.680
I consider that a bug.

02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:12.640
That should take you to before that image,

02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:14.080
that you will see that image.

02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:19.920
Anyway, 20, oh, oh shoot, it's not done yet.

02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:22.320
Do we, when do we fill out the whole thing?

02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:24.000
Gosh darn it Linus.

02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:26.800
Get on with it.

02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:28.880
Here we go.

02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:33.920
Okay, so right now, 18%, oh, this is 20,

02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:38.160
there's 20, 20, thank you.

02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:40.240
That's great.

02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:43.360
It's a good platform, good content creator.

02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:48.240
All right, so in 2020, 26% of our revenue was AdSense,

02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:53.440
with 27% being in video sponsor spots and sponsored projects.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:57.680
So based on this alone, I would say that there would be

02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:01.520
absolutely no need for us to have in video sponsor spots

02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:03.360
or sponsored projects, which both kind of fall

02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:07.440
under sponsored videos, if our CPMs were triple what they are.

02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:12.800
With that said, I don't think that content creators

02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:14.400
would necessarily see it that way.

02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:15.760
Like if YouTube came to us and said,

02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:17.600
yeah, we're going to triple your payout,

02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:21.120
I think that, I mean, I can't speak for everyone,

02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:23.840
but I think that for myself, I would go sick.

02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:26.400
Let's hire more people and build more, right?

02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:29.440
Wouldn't necessarily stop making sponsorship spots

02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:32.080
or float plane reads or whatever else into our videos.

02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:35.520
I'd probably just try to build it bigger.

02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:37.840
I feel like that will always be Linus' answer.

02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:40.880
Yeah, I had-

02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:41.520
I gotta be me.

02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:47.680
We had a call earlier this week with a company who was very,

02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:50.560
very surprised at the amount of stuff that we do

02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:55.040
and the amount of collaboration between teams that we need.

02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:57.520
They were like, we have literally never seen this.

02:41:57.520 --> 02:41:59.280
And I'm like, yeah, it's not surprising,

02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:00.320
but we still need this to work.

02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:02.080
Yeah.

02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:04.880
I'm going to leave it vague like that.

02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:07.360
But like, yeah, I think if there's opportunity

02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:09.680
to do more stuff, it's pretty much always going to be taken.

02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:13.440
As long as it's reasonable, I guess.

02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:16.240
Okay, next up.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:27.760
He's going to say VR.

02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:31.360
I actually know.

02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:32.800
I had a different thing I was going to say,

02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:34.880
but I was fighting between the two of them in my head.

02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:38.800
The Bing chat reaction that we had on WAN was like pretty sick.

02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:41.360
Yeah, certainly recently.

02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:43.120
I don't know if it's my favorite memory though.

02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:47.360
That's the biggest mind absolutely blown moment.

02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:50.800
I mean, there's been so many.

02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:53.040
And there's different ways for your mind to be blown, right?

02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:57.920
My mind was very blown the first time I was able to game in stereo 3D.

02:42:58.720 --> 02:42:59.120
Yeah, yeah.

02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:04.080
Having that at home in my lifetime wasn't a thing that had existed.

02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:07.520
And in such a compact, manageable package,

02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:12.160
Batman Arkham Asylum 3D vision was sick.

02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:13.920
And then the fact that you could do it with projectors,

02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:16.720
like, wow, so cool.

02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:21.440
But sometimes I'm just blown away by the value of something.

02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:27.520
You know, like, what about the bang for the buck of the 8800 GT?

02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:29.440
I mean, I don't think anything will ever touch it again.

02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:32.640
8800 was a hell of a time.

02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:35.680
It was a wonderful time for PC gaming.

02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:37.280
Oh yeah, it was good.

02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:39.680
Future felt bright.

02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:41.760
Yeah, but then like recently, man,

02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:44.800
we were doing this small form factor build that the video is not up yet,

02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:45.920
but it's coming soon.

02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:47.920
But I forget what the watch of it is,

02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:50.480
but it was like a 1200 watt power supply.

02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:52.480
And it's like this big, like, what?

02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:53.600
Right?

02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:54.160
Like, I don't know.

02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:59.440
My mind, my entire job is basically to get my mind blown on a regular basis.

02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:04.800
Yeah, it's no wonder I'm always so relaxed and such a good mood.

02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:08.160
Hit me again.

02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:09.360
You're also very honest.

02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:11.600
All right, next up.

02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:15.280
Luke and Linus, what are your thoughts on game devs hosting old,

02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:18.160
but still popular multiplayer games like Teamforces 2

02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:20.160
without anti-cheat updates?

02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:24.080
And instead relying entirely on modded and community support?

02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:25.520
This might not be taken super,

02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:28.560
people might not like me for this is what I should say,

02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:33.120
but sure, it's better than them taking everything out

02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:34.800
and offlining the game completely.

02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:37.920
It's not like the best solution.

02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:39.440
If there's a lot of people still playing your game,

02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:41.120
I would like to see it supported.

02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:43.680
But when was TF2 first launch?

02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:45.680
Oh my God, like 15 years ago or something?

02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:48.160
Like Orange Box 2007.

02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:50.240
It was launched before Orange Box.

02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:52.400
2004 then, maybe?

02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:53.920
No, 2007.

02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:57.040
October 10th, 2004.

02:44:57.040 --> 02:44:59.520
Wait, no, that is the Orange Box.

02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:02.000
It wasn't launched with Orange Box.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:02.480
Yeah, it was.

02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:05.440
2004 was Half-Life 2.

02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:07.520
Half-Life, no, wait, hold on.

02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:10.480
It was launched alongside Portal, wasn't it?

02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:12.960
These are like the only two dates that I know.

02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:17.440
Yeah, Portal came out in October 2007.

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:19.360
Oh, wow, it was with Orange Box?

02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:21.120
I thought it existed before Orange Box.

02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:21.360
No.

02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:22.560
Crazy.

02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:24.240
Okay, well, never mind then.

02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:29.600
Yeah, it's been a lot of years.

02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:32.000
I think it would be quite the stretch

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.280
to expect companies to support games for longer than that.

02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:37.040
Yes, it still has a big player base,

02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:40.400
but then are you asking companies to integrate?

02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:42.160
They're also still making money on that game,

02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:45.680
so I do expect support, but go on.

02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:48.400
We're talking about Hat Trading Simulator.

02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:51.360
They sell the hats, you can buy them?

02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:52.240
I think so.

02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:53.680
I thought they were just like random loot.

02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:56.400
I don't know, I don't care about that part of the game.

02:45:56.400 --> 02:45:57.760
Unlock crates to unlock the hat.

02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.040
You get crates and you buy keys?

02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:00.560
Yeah, like I think there's also crafting.

02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:03.520
If they're still profiting off of it,

02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:06.480
like damn, they should still support it properly.

02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:07.920
Yes, 100%.

02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:11.120
If they're not profiting off of it anymore,

02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:13.600
then it is what it is.

02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:14.800
At least they're keeping it up there,

02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:16.480
and they have the availability of people

02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:18.320
being able to patch things.

02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:18.880
That's great.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:23.440
Apparently it's big for gambling.

02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:25.360
Oh, great.

02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:32.320
All right, next one.

02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:33.040
Another one.

02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:35.280
Hey, LL&D and Future Me.

02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:37.360
I always watch the show the next morning,

02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:39.040
but do you think there's any good way

02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:41.680
to have a Town Square social platform

02:46:41.680 --> 02:46:47.040
that truly reaches everyone and can be a public utility?

02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:50.000
In my utopian nirvana, yes.

02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:52.800
In order for it to be a public utility,

02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:55.200
it would actually have to be publicly owned.

02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:57.040
So it would have to be government run.

02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:59.600
And to be government run and still viable,

02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:02.880
it would have to be efficient, which is sort of a contradiction.

02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:06.160
So we want it to be run with the efficiency

02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:08.320
of a cutthroat for profit enterprise,

02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:11.520
but we want it to have the openness

02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:14.880
of a publicly funded entity like a library or a school.

02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:18.800
No, I don't.

02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:22.240
I don't see a path to that.

02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:24.400
I mean, I would have liked to believe

02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:28.240
that through something like blockchain technology,

02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:30.240
you could build something like that,

02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:32.560
but the crypto community has been really busy

02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:33.920
building Ponzi schemes,

02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:36.160
so they haven't really had time for

02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:43.040
It's super sick that no one cares about NFTs anymore, though.

02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:43.840
I do enjoy that.

02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:45.280
It's very fun.

02:47:46.640 --> 02:47:49.760
Has anyone created a how much did they lose website

02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:54.240
that just has a summary of who lost the most money on NFTs?

02:47:54.240 --> 02:47:55.520
That would be sweet.

02:47:58.240 --> 02:47:59.280
More, more, more.

02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:01.680
Yeah, I really just don't see a solution.

02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:04.080
And anyone who thinks that the current solution on Twitter

02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:07.200
is an actual solution has missed the boat.

02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:10.000
Is it better than not having it?

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:10.800
Absolutely not.

02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:18.720
Having one ego driven billionaire who's the arbiter

02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:26.960
of what is truth and what is right is not actually not a solution.

02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:29.120
That's actually medieval.

02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:32.720
No.

02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:38.720
Next one.

02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:43.360
Hey, DLLL, you pretty much have a rapid prototyping team

02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:45.360
for anything you can think of.

02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:49.280
With the specs of four framework modules being open source,

02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:52.400
what's a module you'd like to make looking forward to LTX?

02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:56.160
Oh, a module?

02:48:56.160 --> 02:48:56.960
Man, I don't know.

02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:00.880
My framework laptop already kind of does everything

02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:03.280
that I need it to do other than, you know,

02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:05.520
oh, it'd be great if someone could make a way

02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:09.040
to plug an RJ45 jack into it without having a butt

02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:10.320
hanging off of the bottom.

02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:11.680
Yeah, great, that would be awesome,

02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:13.840
but I don't have a solution for that,

02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:16.080
at least not anything durable.

02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:20.080
But I don't know.

02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:21.600
I can't think of anything particularly.

02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:25.040
It has the modules that I would want.

02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:28.320
If I was configuring one, it has the things that I would want.

02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:28.560
Yeah.

02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:31.760
No, like, cup holder or anything?

02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:33.040
Cup holder.

02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:34.720
I mean, they're this big, Dan.

02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:36.320
What kind of cup are you going to put in it?

02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:37.520
It expands out.

02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:41.280
Next up.

02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:42.000
Okay.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.640
Luke and Linus, what is a past purchase price

02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:47.280
that you often compare new purchases to,

02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:49.520
or that was particularly good value?

02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:52.320
Two of mine were a PS3 for $300

02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:54.880
and test three Morrowind for $1.

02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:58.960
So this includes deals.

02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:00.960
My perception of value crystallized,

02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:03.280
and I think about 1996,

02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:08.400
when a candy bar from the dollar store cost $1.

02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:17.520
And so nowadays, I basically can't get myself to buy snacks

02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:21.200
unless they're like a buck or maybe like $2,

02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:22.720
or I have a really hard time with it.

02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:24.400
It's very funny to me that you brought up the candy bar

02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:27.200
for a dollar thing, because a can of pot being a dollar,

02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:30.560
a candy bar being a dollar, and gas being like under a dollar

02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:32.000
is singed in my brain.

02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:35.840
If I see a chocolate bar that's more than a dollar,

02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:37.520
which is all of them.

02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:38.800
No, it's not.

02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:39.520
Really?

02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:44.000
Yeah, in the packs at like superstore, they're like $0.80.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:45.840
Oh, but you have to buy like a bunch of them, right?

02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:46.400
Yeah.

02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:48.080
Okay, but I'm talking like a single one.

02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:51.440
I'm just saying, a dollar candy bar is absolutely still a thing.

02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:52.640
Sustainable, yeah.

02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:54.720
But when I see that on the shelf, a single chocolate bar,

02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:56.800
especially when they're like $2.50,

02:50:56.800 --> 02:50:58.480
yeah, when you get like the fancy ones,

02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:00.240
I just immediately are just like, how?

02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:03.520
I used vending machines until about grade eight,

02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:07.760
and that's when they moved from a dollar to $1.25 for a soda.

02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:09.600
And I was like, that's too much.

02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:11.120
I guess I just don't drink this anymore.

02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:13.360
It's probably good.

02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:14.560
Yeah, yeah.

02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:16.800
That was the best thing that ever happened to me was

02:51:18.800 --> 02:51:19.520
vending machines.

02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:20.640
Vending machine prices going up.

02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:22.720
Increasing past one loony.

02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:23.840
Yeah.

02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:27.200
Okay, up next.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:31.520
Linus, with Call Me Chris Moving because of stocking,

02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:34.640
all accredited to her showing her place in a house tour,

02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:37.920
has this changed your mind about how you shoot videos at your home?

02:51:38.480 --> 02:51:39.040
Not really.

02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:47.200
I mean, I am not subject to the same kind of, I guess, scrutiny that Chris is,

02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:50.960
which is very lucky and very grateful for that.

02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:55.520
I don't know whether it's audience composition or being male or

02:51:56.240 --> 02:52:02.240
being a tech channel rather than something where people form more intense

02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:06.160
parasocial relationships, some combination of all those factors,

02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:07.680
other factors I haven't considered.

02:52:09.120 --> 02:52:16.640
But the address of my place of work has been common knowledge for eight years.

02:52:20.240 --> 02:52:21.440
I ain't hard to find.

02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:24.960
Nobody does it, which is good and right.

02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:28.960
That type of thing has been true for a long time, like TV stations.

02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:36.400
I mean, you could literally often walk behind the glass on the ground floor TV stations

02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:38.080
and wave into the camera.

02:52:38.080 --> 02:52:40.960
Like this type of stuff has been possible for a while, hopefully.

02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:42.480
Most people are not creeps.

02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:45.120
Yeah, most, they exist, but yeah.

02:52:45.120 --> 02:52:52.880
But some of them are, and I'm very grateful to our community for not being awful people.

02:52:55.920 --> 02:52:59.360
Yeah, no, I can't say it's really changed my mind about anything because

02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:05.600
if I couldn't make videos about what I'm doing, would you even watch them?

02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:09.520
Like I, that's the whole, that's the whole point, right?

02:53:09.520 --> 02:53:13.280
Like it's YouTube, it's not fabrication tube, right?

02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:18.560
Yeah, it's a really bad situation though.

02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:22.560
Do you want another?

02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:23.840
Better paint job at the new place.

02:53:24.400 --> 02:53:26.160
Yeah, we can only hope.

02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:31.600
Chris, if you're watching, I will happily, I will happily help you out with your painting.

02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:33.440
The last collab was fantastic, so that'd be fun.

02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:34.160
Yeah, I'm down.

02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:38.560
Well, we won't build a computer this time because that was painful, but we'll paint.

02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:43.200
Or?

02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:43.520
Yes?

02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:44.160
Yep.

02:53:44.160 --> 02:53:46.080
Yeah, I mean, this is the rest of the show, Dan.

02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:48.000
You got to prompt me, Heather, I keep interrupting you.

02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:50.240
No, no, you're good, just talk over us.

02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:51.680
You're trying to get this thing done, right?

02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:54.000
Yeah, sure, yeah, boss, okay.

02:53:54.720 --> 02:53:57.760
Wondering how the pool at Linus's house is coming along.

02:53:57.760 --> 02:53:59.680
I curated this, I curated this.

02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:00.640
I certainly didn't.

02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:02.560
Wait, isn't that you?

02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:06.080
There you go, oh, oh, you got to blow a raspberry as well.

02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:09.920
Jeez.

02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:12.640
So yeah, how's it going?

02:54:12.640 --> 02:54:13.200
Sounds good.

02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:16.000
Yeah, I'm sure perfectly.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:20.400
If everything goes according to, this is a very first world problem,

02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:22.080
but it's just a ridiculous problem.

02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:24.000
Instead of laying all the tiles one way,

02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:28.720
some of the tiles on the sides go this way and the tiles on the ends go that way,

02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:36.080
they offered to redo it and we're just like, no, just get it done, please.

02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:41.760
If everything goes according to plan, it will be ugly, but finished in three weeks.

02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:44.480
I don't believe it.

02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:45.440
I've heard this before.

02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:49.920
Oh yeah, I don't know, I'm on the fence, man.

02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:52.160
I don't know whether to name and shame these guys at the end.

02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:53.600
I'm very tempted though.

02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:58.000
They've basically done every scummy contractor trick in the book,

02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:03.680
and some that weren't in any books that I read because I don't read impolite books like that.

02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:11.760
I like, to a certain degree, I think you probably should.

02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:12.560
Well, here's the problem.

02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:13.920
Because they shouldn't be able to do that.

02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:18.400
I want them to never do business again.

02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:18.720
Yeah.

02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:21.280
Based on what's going on, but here's the thing.

02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:27.680
Based on what I've gleaned about their operation and what I can assume to be at least a reasonably

02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:34.160
accurate guess, I think that they are in dire straits right now and are using funding from

02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:39.200
one project to work on another and then collecting money from that and then using that to continue

02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:42.480
to work on the other and they're bouncing around between job sites right now.

02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:48.320
So if I destroy their means to collect any more money at all,

02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:53.840
I could be ultimately screwing over some of those clients as well.

02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:57.360
Do I have a responsibility for that collateral damage?

02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:04.320
He has to throw up just thinking about his very conflicted feeling right now.

02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:06.720
He's, oh, what did you eat?

02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:07.440
Not on the carpet.

02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:08.000
That's disgusting.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:08.720
Not on the carpet.

02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:09.040
What?

02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:10.080
That's my crying carpet.

02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:12.320
Oh, were you insinuating I was farting or something?

02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:14.240
Ah, yes.

02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:15.600
Very stinky.

02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:20.960
Yeah, I don't know, but at the same time they could be acquiring new customers.

02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:22.640
Yeah.

02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:26.880
So then it's a tough spot to be in, for sure.

02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:32.480
If they, in good faith, are just going through a bad time and trying to use the new customers

02:56:32.480 --> 02:56:34.640
to get everything done and they're like, going to try and get caught up.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:37.360
Do you think that's what's happening?

02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:37.600
No.

02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:40.320
Yeah, because it doesn't seem like it.

02:56:40.320 --> 02:56:41.120
Yeah, I don't think so.

02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:47.440
I don't know.

02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:48.640
It's rough.

02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:50.240
Yeah.

02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:52.320
Okay, next up.

02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:53.120
Hi, LLD.

02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:59.040
I work in an environment with very few tech-savvy people and a lot of efficiency issues.

02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:03.760
How would you approach trying to get through the resistance to tech we experience with publishing?

02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:08.080
Huh.

02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:09.760
With publishing?

02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:11.680
I don't know.

02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:15.600
You just have to wait for people to retire out at a certain point.

02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:25.760
People can be pretty set in their ways and it's not constructive, but I forget what this law or this

02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:37.440
bias or whatever is called, but there's sometimes a lot of justifiability to the

02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:39.520
wall if it ain't broke, don't fix it approach.

02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:44.960
We create a lot of inefficiencies by just throwing more tech at the problem.

02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:52.000
It cuts both ways, but largely you're probably right that a little more tech would go a long way,

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.080
but how to fix it?

02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:54.480
I don't know.

02:57:54.480 --> 02:57:55.200
It's tough.

02:57:55.200 --> 02:58:01.280
I was actually meant to make this a topic and maybe I'll hijack this message and turn

02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:10.400
it into a topic right now, but I went to NASA at Houston last technically weekend and also earlier

02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:10.960
this week.

02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:13.840
I wasn't going to say it because I wasn't sure if you were going to talk about it for whatever

02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:16.480
reason, but it sounded like a sick trip.

02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:17.600
Absolutely amazing.

02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:18.480
Absolutely incredible.

02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:23.920
The people that brought us down there, the two main people that, well, the main person who reached

02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:29.760
out is a part of the Mission Control Center design group.

02:58:30.240 --> 02:58:30.720
Sick.

02:58:30.720 --> 02:58:31.600
It has a different name.

02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:36.160
I believe it's called flight operations, but basically they designed, so each mission has

02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:40.800
a slightly different Mission Control Center because they're going for like these crazy

02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:43.520
efficiency levels and there's different demands and all this type of stuff.

02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:46.720
So they will design a new Mission Control Center for every mission.

02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:54.000
And I sort of thought that there was like one and like, I know like SpaceX has one, but I

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.400
thought NASA had like a Mission Control Center.

02:58:56.400 --> 02:58:57.360
I don't know why I thought that.

02:58:57.360 --> 02:58:57.840
I just did.

02:58:58.800 --> 02:59:00.000
No, there's like a bunch.

02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:02.480
They're all in the same building, but there's a bunch.

02:59:02.480 --> 02:59:05.360
And when you walk through them, they are, they're a little bit different because there's

02:59:05.360 --> 02:59:06.720
slightly different demands.

02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:14.160
And these people have to try to push new tech onto these operators that will have to now

02:59:14.160 --> 02:59:16.400
train on this new tech and use it.

02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:22.400
So this might be someone who has worked this one very hyper intense.

02:59:22.960 --> 02:59:25.040
We talked about like the things that they have to do.

02:59:25.040 --> 02:59:31.520
You have to listen to the loop of all conversations going on and pull out keywords that might

02:59:31.520 --> 02:59:32.800
involve something that you have to do.

02:59:33.360 --> 02:59:37.600
So you're constantly listening to multiple conversations at a time and have to be operating

02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:41.360
at like a really, really high level.

02:59:41.360 --> 02:59:42.400
Life-critical level.

02:59:42.400 --> 02:59:43.200
Yeah.

02:59:43.200 --> 02:59:44.160
Just your whole shift.

02:59:44.960 --> 02:59:46.000
Really, really intense.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:50.480
So like if you want to push a new keyboard setup.

02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:51.520
Sure.

02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:53.760
Yeah, you're going to tech Dvorak now.

02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:58.480
Yeah, like there's probably going to be a lot of resistance and with pretty good reason.

02:59:58.480 --> 03:00:00.960
You might have good reasons too, right?

03:00:00.960 --> 03:00:01.840
This is more efficient.

03:00:01.840 --> 03:00:02.800
We think you can do it this way.

03:00:02.800 --> 03:00:04.560
So you can get this thing done with slightly less clicks.

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:06.160
So you can do whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:08.240
This mouse is faster, whatever.

03:00:08.240 --> 03:00:13.520
But if something is battle tested already, there's a lot of resistance because I mean,

03:00:13.520 --> 03:00:17.760
it's not broken and like lives are on the line, lives and billions of dollars.

03:00:19.040 --> 03:00:23.440
So like it's tough, very, very interesting conversations.

03:00:23.440 --> 03:00:26.400
I think you should absolutely go make videos there.

03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:29.360
I met a PR person, talked to them about it.

03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:30.000
They're interested.

03:00:30.560 --> 03:00:37.520
What I really want to do is the first manned mission to either to go around the moon or to

03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:38.800
land on the moon.

03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:43.680
I want to have you work with these mission control center designer guys to make a video

03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:48.560
on how you design the like computer and electronics and networking and video feeds and everything

03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:51.120
for a mission control center for a manned launch,

03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:53.360
which is like way more intense than an unmanned launch.

03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:57.280
To be clear, Luke is not a moon landing denialist.

03:00:57.280 --> 03:00:59.280
He met the first moon landing mission in a long time.

03:00:59.280 --> 03:01:00.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:00.960
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:01.680
Well, okay.

03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:04.960
What I was really talking about was the first one where they set up a base.

03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:07.280
I just, I'm sure I said it poorly.

03:01:07.280 --> 03:01:09.840
I'm a little bit too excited because it was an extremely fun trip.

03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:10.400
Yeah, you guys.

03:01:11.040 --> 03:01:14.960
But yeah, they were talking about like the difficulties there, but also the understanding

03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:20.480
that like there's reasons why these people would push back and it is actually a good thing

03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:25.600
because you kind of end up in the middle and they are constantly like they have this one

03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:30.960
display, which is a like control center from like, I shouldn't say a control center,

03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:36.080
an individual person's control unit in a mission control center.

03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:39.120
They have like three of them from three different generations.

03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:42.960
And like you can see the similarities between like the first ones that they have and the

03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:47.600
ones that they have now, but they have made a lot of evolutionary changes.

03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:51.600
Yeah, I mean, I guess having that push and pull is a very natural

03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:52.800
thing.

03:01:52.800 --> 03:01:57.600
Like it's kind of like how, you know, we have departments that are incentivized,

03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:01.120
that are given incentives that are opposed to each other.

03:02:01.120 --> 03:02:06.240
You know, for example, the business team has the objective of generating as much sponsorship

03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:11.840
revenue as possible, but the content team has the objective of getting as many views as possible.

03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:18.080
Well, surely the most profitable thing would be to just upload sponsor read after sponsor read.

03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:24.160
And the most viewable thing would be to have no sponsors whatsoever and just make whatever

03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:24.640
you want.

03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:28.720
So you got to kind of need this back and forth to land in the right spot.

03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:30.560
So it's, it's very interesting.

03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:38.640
And the writing team has output targets, but then I have quality targets.

03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:40.160
And so does the editing team.

03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:44.800
And so it's like, well, yeah, we sure we could output more, but we can't output that.

03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:47.200
So you're going to have to go back to the drawing board then.

03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:49.120
Yeah, yeah.

03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:54.320
Luke denies lunar landing confirmed.

03:02:54.320 --> 03:02:54.800
Yep.

03:02:54.800 --> 03:02:55.280
100%.

03:02:55.280 --> 03:02:56.480
I just said it wrong.

03:02:56.480 --> 03:02:56.960
Someone said.

03:02:56.960 --> 03:02:57.680
Believe in the moon.

03:02:57.680 --> 03:02:58.720
Wake up sheeple.

03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:00.240
Samsung proved it's fake.

03:03:01.280 --> 03:03:06.000
Captain ran in full plane chat said 75% of the planet is water and none of it is carbonated.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:06.800
The earth is flat.

03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:07.920
I thought that was really funny.

03:03:11.120 --> 03:03:13.200
That's the first time I've heard that.

03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:14.480
That's amazing.

03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:15.200
Okay.

03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:17.120
Wow.

03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:18.880
But yeah, that was an actually incredible trip.

03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:23.040
There's a few other ideas that I have for content pieces you might be able to make around

03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:24.720
that, but we'll talk later.

03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:26.720
But they're all like, super cool.

03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:33.680
I was trying to pitch AV one because like, you know, network connections can be kind of rough.

03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:37.840
But there's like a lot of issues he was talking to me about.

03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:38.960
And this totally makes sense.

03:03:39.040 --> 03:03:43.120
But radiation in space is like way more of a problem.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
We have issues down here when there's like a solar flare.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:47.280
You might have bit flips.

03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:47.520
Yeah.

03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:49.840
Well, they have those problems like just all the time.

03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:54.960
And they have like space weather experts that can try to predict this stuff coming up,

03:03:54.960 --> 03:03:58.800
but it still doesn't help you from a bunch of bit flips all happening at the same time.

03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:03.840
And like there's also cosmic radiation that comes from not just the sun.

03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:05.920
So you can't necessarily see it coming.

03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:11.120
And they set up systems where like they'll have three computers doing the same things

03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:15.680
and they'll vote on a result instead of just having one computer control it.

03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:19.840
So like if two of them agree or hopefully all three of them agree,

03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:21.680
then you can be pretty sure that it's good.

03:04:21.680 --> 03:04:25.120
But it's decently common that one of them will be like a bit flipped and just be like,

03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:26.240
oh, this other thing.

03:04:26.800 --> 03:04:32.480
So I just very interesting the type of problems that they have to deal with you,

03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:34.240
which you might not necessarily expect.

03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:38.000
But apparently AV1 is an issue because of licensing agreements,

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:38.720
all those types of stuff.

03:04:38.720 --> 03:04:39.120
I don't know.

03:04:39.120 --> 03:04:40.320
Anyways, yeah.

03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:43.600
Dan and Darren, we're working on an x-ray machine.

03:04:44.720 --> 03:04:45.520
You're what?

03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:46.400
For the lab.

03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:46.720
Yes.

03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:47.920
Yeah, I want one.

03:04:47.920 --> 03:04:48.400
Thank you.

03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:49.200
Awesome.

03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:49.920
I'm kind of sick.

03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:50.160
Yeah.

03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:52.320
All right.

03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:56.400
My whole thing with the lab is I never want the excuse to be you didn't give us the proper equipment.

03:04:57.520 --> 03:04:59.200
Don't don't say that publicly.

03:04:59.200 --> 03:04:59.760
I already did.

03:05:01.040 --> 03:05:01.520
Say it again.

03:05:02.160 --> 03:05:05.280
I never want the excuse to be that I didn't give you the proper equipment.

03:05:05.280 --> 03:05:05.520
Good.

03:05:05.520 --> 03:05:06.320
That's a great approach.

03:05:06.320 --> 03:05:06.640
Yeah.

03:05:06.640 --> 03:05:07.040
I love it.

03:05:08.640 --> 03:05:09.200
Okay.

03:05:09.200 --> 03:05:09.680
Next up.

03:05:10.480 --> 03:05:12.080
Hello, Linus and Luke.

03:05:12.080 --> 03:05:17.680
I recently inherited a micro cloud server, the super micro 939-20.

03:05:17.680 --> 03:05:22.240
12 rails with two Xeons, RAM and storage on each rail.

03:05:22.240 --> 03:05:24.560
Any ideas what I should do with it in my home?

03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:29.040
Is that 24 CPUs?

03:05:29.040 --> 03:05:30.960
What are 12 rails?

03:05:30.960 --> 03:05:32.640
12 individual blade servers.

03:05:32.640 --> 03:05:35.120
Yeah, I was going to say, I think it was just...

03:05:35.120 --> 03:05:40.560
Oh, it's got 12 individual servers with two Xeons in them each.

03:05:43.120 --> 03:05:43.440
Wow.

03:05:44.560 --> 03:05:45.280
Micro cloud.

03:05:45.280 --> 03:05:46.720
It looks like it's a for you unit.

03:05:49.440 --> 03:05:49.760
Wow.

03:05:50.560 --> 03:05:50.800
Yeah.

03:05:52.320 --> 03:05:56.720
I can't even find that model 939-20.

03:05:57.520 --> 03:05:59.840
Yeah, I cannot find that.

03:06:01.360 --> 03:06:04.080
Any ideas what I should do with it for my home?

03:06:06.240 --> 03:06:08.240
With that kind of power consumption?

03:06:09.440 --> 03:06:09.680
No?

03:06:10.800 --> 03:06:15.600
I mean, you could use one of them as like a Plex server or something maybe,

03:06:15.600 --> 03:06:20.880
but the reality of it is like, you could definitely use them for learning still.

03:06:21.680 --> 03:06:22.480
If you wanted to...

03:06:24.800 --> 03:06:29.680
Like if you wanted to just learn about storage and configure them,

03:06:29.760 --> 03:06:34.320
or if you wanted to use them to create a whole bunch of clients and learn about active directory,

03:06:34.320 --> 03:06:36.400
like I don't know, there's a reason people build home labs,

03:06:36.400 --> 03:06:40.880
but in terms of practical use for it, pretty hard to say.

03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:42.880
There's a...

03:06:42.880 --> 03:06:43.840
I'm going to jump back.

03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:46.000
Sorry, I'm excited about this topic.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:47.200
So when a full plane chat said,

03:06:47.200 --> 03:06:50.960
they use specialized power PC processors that are radiation hardened

03:06:50.960 --> 03:06:53.200
and are manufactured on older process nodes,

03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:57.200
I think some of them are based on the power PC G3,

03:06:57.200 --> 03:07:00.400
which was also used in a 1998 iMac.

03:07:00.400 --> 03:07:02.880
Yeah, so we didn't talk about the specific processors,

03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:06.880
but we did talk about how some modern process nodes can be an issue,

03:07:06.880 --> 03:07:10.400
because when they have a bit of radiation come in that's going to flip a bunch of bits,

03:07:10.400 --> 03:07:16.480
having the transistors further apart can actually help less data problems.

03:07:17.920 --> 03:07:18.560
Very interesting.

03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:23.360
Also, they were talking about how just in general,

03:07:23.360 --> 03:07:26.640
a lot of older hardware has less problems with radiation.

03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:27.200
That makes sense.

03:07:27.200 --> 03:07:28.400
For a bunch of different reasons.

03:07:28.400 --> 03:07:29.600
Bigger, fatter traces.

03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:34.640
And those things not being made is actually an issue for NASA,

03:07:34.640 --> 03:07:36.320
moving forward, very, very interesting.

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
Yeah.

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:43.760
So no idea what you're going to make them do with this micro cloud server.

03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:46.480
I don't want to be a party pooper,

03:07:46.480 --> 03:07:48.400
but like I said, just probably sell it.

03:07:48.400 --> 03:07:49.920
It's a bit of a ridiculous thing.

03:07:50.800 --> 03:07:52.880
High Linus, you're the best.

03:07:52.880 --> 03:07:56.320
What's your opinion on some of the concept tech products?

03:07:56.320 --> 03:07:58.640
I really like the Nothing Phone 2 concept.

03:07:59.440 --> 03:08:03.360
First of all, no, I think I'm all right.

03:08:03.360 --> 03:08:06.640
But the best is, wow, that's thank you, but no.

03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:09.920
Nothing Phone 2.

03:08:09.920 --> 03:08:11.040
I actually haven't seen this.

03:08:14.560 --> 03:08:17.600
What's your, on some of the concept tech products?

03:08:18.800 --> 03:08:20.480
Concept, what makes it a concept?

03:08:23.120 --> 03:08:24.080
Concept renders.

03:08:24.880 --> 03:08:26.240
All right.

03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:27.360
Well, here, let's have a look here.

03:08:28.480 --> 03:08:29.200
Okay.

03:08:29.200 --> 03:08:31.360
I mean, yeah, it looks pretty cool, I guess.

03:08:32.560 --> 03:08:38.960
I don't know which other things you're saying are concept products,

03:08:38.960 --> 03:08:40.960
but yeah, that looks pretty cool.

03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:41.920
We can move on, I think.

03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:42.880
Sorry.

03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:47.360
Hello, Luke, Linus, and Dan.

03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:52.240
Do you think that the work valve has put into DVXK plus proton

03:08:52.240 --> 03:08:54.240
can be applied to macOS?

03:08:54.240 --> 03:08:58.240
What, with the metal to Vulcan translation layer, molten VK?

03:08:58.240 --> 03:09:00.160
Why does Apple lock out gamers?

03:09:01.120 --> 03:09:04.000
I can't figure out what Apple has against gamers,

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:05.520
to be perfectly honest with you.

03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:10.000
It's baffling, especially when you consider that on the one hand,

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:15.280
they do totally recognize that gaming is a huge market,

03:09:15.280 --> 03:09:19.440
and even a huge revenue source for them now through the App Store,

03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:25.680
through Apple Arcade, I can't fathom it.

03:09:28.240 --> 03:09:30.480
Especially when they, didn't they own,

03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:32.320
no, I don't think they owned Bungie,

03:09:32.320 --> 03:09:35.120
but Halo was initially going to be a...

03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:36.080
Mac exclusive.

03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:36.640
Yeah.

03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:39.200
They had tons of exclusive games back in the day.

03:09:40.560 --> 03:09:44.240
And nowadays, it's like watching a bunch of boomers

03:09:44.240 --> 03:09:45.600
who have never touched a video game

03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:47.440
when they do gaming demos on stage.

03:09:47.440 --> 03:09:48.160
It's bizarre.

03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:51.840
Like, it wasn't like that.

03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:54.720
If you watch Apple Keynotes from like back in the 90s,

03:09:55.360 --> 03:09:56.800
they talked about gaming.

03:09:57.680 --> 03:09:58.720
Gaming was a thing.

03:10:00.480 --> 03:10:01.760
I have no idea what happened.

03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:07.360
As for like a translation layer, I mean, yeah, I guess, but...

03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:13.760
I wouldn't put the work into it, honestly.

03:10:16.080 --> 03:10:18.240
By the way, I missed something on the story earlier.

03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:19.760
We now have women's V-necks.

03:10:20.320 --> 03:10:21.120
Oh, cool.

03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:21.920
Yeah.

03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:26.320
So this sketchy PC design is available in an actual,

03:10:26.320 --> 03:10:27.680
like, women's shirt.

03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:28.640
Okay, sorry, that was it.

03:10:31.280 --> 03:10:32.000
Dan, hit me.

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.160
Sorry, I was just responding to some more.

03:10:35.440 --> 03:10:36.000
Let's see.

03:10:40.800 --> 03:10:42.800
There are many things I would like to do this year.

03:10:42.800 --> 03:10:45.600
Despite GPT helping me become more efficient,

03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:49.040
I am still barely able to get my basic stuff done.

03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:52.880
How do you manage your time to run LTT plus the other LLCs?

03:10:56.160 --> 03:10:59.360
Yeah, a lot of help, right?

03:10:59.360 --> 03:11:01.760
I have 100 people that help me do it.

03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:03.280
So it's...

03:11:03.840 --> 03:11:06.640
I don't think I do a great job of managing my time these days.

03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:10.800
He agrees, but he's busy typing,

03:11:10.800 --> 03:11:12.640
so he's not really listening to what I'm saying.

03:11:12.640 --> 03:11:13.600
No, but I do agree.

03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:15.360
Like, I don't know...

03:11:15.920 --> 03:11:16.720
I don't know what...

03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:19.360
I don't have a solution,

03:11:19.360 --> 03:11:21.360
so I try not to complain about it too much

03:11:21.360 --> 03:11:22.720
because I've tried to get over that.

03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:30.240
But yeah, it's impossible to meet with you

03:11:30.240 --> 03:11:31.760
about important things.

03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:34.080
Like, the full play meeting this week got canceled.

03:11:34.880 --> 03:11:35.840
And it's just like, man.

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:38.320
Okay.

03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:43.200
But again, I don't have a solution for it.

03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:44.480
It's just tough.

03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:47.280
Hit me.

03:11:48.320 --> 03:11:48.640
Sure.

03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:52.720
That's all basically all I've got for Curated.

03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:56.560
You guys have lots of potentials to go through still.

03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.160
Let's just start firing through them.

03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:02.560
Okay, which end am I eating from?

03:12:03.440 --> 03:12:05.040
You'll go from the bottom if you want.

03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:05.360
Okay.

03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:07.440
Ryan's.

03:12:08.720 --> 03:12:10.240
Am I supposed to read them out or not?

03:12:10.240 --> 03:12:11.120
However you want to do this,

03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:12.960
you can either reply to them via text

03:12:12.960 --> 03:12:15.120
or we can read them out rapid fire.

03:12:15.120 --> 03:12:15.520
Interesting.

03:12:15.520 --> 03:12:17.040
I don't think we've decided on that.

03:12:17.040 --> 03:12:19.120
I think while we're doing other merch messages,

03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:20.560
you guys kind of go through the potentials.

03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:24.320
By the way, a good suggestion came in through merch messages.

03:12:24.320 --> 03:12:27.440
We should switch the logo to like a Wancho

03:12:27.440 --> 03:12:29.360
after Dark Logo or something cool like that.

03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:32.000
Yeah, I've already put it on my to-list to have a look at that.

03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:32.160
Thanks, Dan.

03:12:32.160 --> 03:12:33.600
I thought that was great.

03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:35.200
See, Ryan T says,

03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:37.360
I enjoy Wancho more when there's fewer questions

03:12:37.360 --> 03:12:38.800
and more discussion about them.

03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:39.840
Have you thought about cutting off

03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:41.280
merch messages halfway through the show

03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:43.760
and switching to an upvote system?

03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:46.000
Upvote system is a pretty cool idea.

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:48.560
However, the curation that we're doing

03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:52.160
is not just based on what people want to see

03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:54.240
because we end up with a lot of duplicate stuff.

03:12:54.240 --> 03:12:56.400
We'd end up with a lot of just,

03:12:56.400 --> 03:12:58.160
you know, what the latest drama is.

03:12:58.160 --> 03:12:59.600
I think it would really change the tone

03:12:59.600 --> 03:13:01.520
of merch messages over time

03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:02.960
when we're going out of our way

03:13:02.960 --> 03:13:06.000
to create a particular tone to the discussion.

03:13:06.880 --> 03:13:08.400
As for switching them off halfway,

03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:12.480
I don't think we would want to do that

03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:14.240
from a business standpoint.

03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:17.440
We definitely want people to order from LTT Store.

03:13:19.280 --> 03:13:21.200
So turning them off is bad.

03:13:21.920 --> 03:13:23.760
But I like the idea.

03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:24.880
I like where it's coming from.

03:13:24.880 --> 03:13:26.400
I think if we were going to do an upvote system

03:13:26.400 --> 03:13:28.240
for questions, we'd probably just do another AMA.

03:13:28.240 --> 03:13:29.120
It's been kind of a while.

03:13:30.160 --> 03:13:31.760
Yeah, something like that could make sense.

03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:32.480
Yeah.

03:13:32.480 --> 03:13:35.040
Okay, well, build an AMA system

03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:35.920
and then we'll do it on float.

03:13:37.360 --> 03:13:37.920
Alrighty then.

03:13:39.360 --> 03:13:42.320
You could just make a post asking for questions

03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:45.120
and you could reply to them

03:13:45.120 --> 03:13:46.720
like a Reddit thread if you wanted.

03:13:47.280 --> 03:13:49.280
Can I just shout out our team

03:13:49.280 --> 03:13:51.360
that works on merch messages real quick here?

03:13:51.360 --> 03:13:51.680
Team.

03:13:53.280 --> 03:13:54.080
Yeah, I know.

03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:55.360
But like, yeah.

03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:56.320
Good job, Conrad.

03:13:56.320 --> 03:13:58.480
We've got to give credit to the team, you know?

03:13:58.480 --> 03:14:01.440
I mean, there is other people involved, technically.

03:14:01.440 --> 03:14:01.920
Yeah.

03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:04.080
Yeah.

03:14:04.080 --> 03:14:05.120
Okay, so this is really cool.

03:14:05.120 --> 03:14:06.880
This was sitting in incoming

03:14:06.960 --> 03:14:09.120
and I almost finished replying to it

03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:11.120
and someone moved it into potential.

03:14:11.120 --> 03:14:14.560
So it disappeared and that text is still here.

03:14:14.560 --> 03:14:17.760
So all I had to do was add S to my signature

03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:19.200
and now I have replied to it.

03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:20.560
Super cool.

03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:23.520
Supposed to be doing potentials, not incoming.

03:14:23.520 --> 03:14:24.480
I am doing potentials.

03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:25.600
So they moved it into...

03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:26.160
Oh, I see.

03:14:27.040 --> 03:14:28.240
Yes, I screwed that up.

03:14:29.200 --> 03:14:30.320
Anonymous asks,

03:14:30.320 --> 03:14:33.840
I'm a 20-something wanting to start a YouTube business.

03:14:33.840 --> 03:14:36.640
What keeps you going during the difficult times?

03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:37.840
And if things didn't work out,

03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:40.000
at what point do you just call it and move on?

03:14:40.720 --> 03:14:42.960
I can get along being jobless.

03:14:45.120 --> 03:14:47.040
Okay, what keeps you going during the difficult times?

03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:50.880
I mean, for me, the biggest thing that gets me out of bed in the morning

03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:52.880
is that if I don't come here,

03:14:52.880 --> 03:14:55.200
other people will have nothing to do

03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:56.720
and will ultimately lose their jobs.

03:14:57.600 --> 03:14:58.960
There are definitely times.

03:14:58.960 --> 03:15:02.080
I mean, when I posted the I'm Thinking of Retiring video,

03:15:02.880 --> 03:15:04.560
I probably would have just done it

03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:06.720
if it wasn't for the responsibility to the team.

03:15:07.360 --> 03:15:14.480
I was either debt-free or I had being debt-free on the horizon.

03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:16.320
That is no longer the case.

03:15:17.920 --> 03:15:19.280
But at that time, I did.

03:15:20.800 --> 03:15:26.400
And I just was feeling pretty unmotivated.

03:15:26.400 --> 03:15:30.560
But if I quit, then everyone quits, which sucks.

03:15:30.560 --> 03:15:31.760
That's stupid.

03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:33.840
So here I am, right?

03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:37.280
As far if it doesn't work out, at what point do you call it?

03:15:37.280 --> 03:15:38.880
I'd say when you stop enjoying it,

03:15:38.880 --> 03:15:42.480
because the thing about YouTube is that you've got to find a passion.

03:15:42.480 --> 03:15:43.760
And like I said in that video,

03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:46.800
I just had to find a different framing device for my passion.

03:15:46.800 --> 03:15:49.040
I had to get passionate about something different.

03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:51.760
And if I hadn't been able to do it, I would have had to call it.

03:15:51.760 --> 03:15:54.240
So if you're just not passionate about it anymore,

03:15:54.800 --> 03:15:57.520
there's no way you're going to be able to create passion in others.

03:15:57.520 --> 03:16:00.240
So it's time to, it's probably time to call it.

03:16:02.080 --> 03:16:04.160
Okay, I've got a curated one here for you.

03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:04.560
Hit me.

03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:06.000
Hi, DLL.

03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:10.080
I recently screen shared a chat where we were talking trash about a vendor

03:16:10.080 --> 03:16:12.400
on a call with that vendor.

03:16:12.400 --> 03:16:14.960
What's your most embarrassing screen share moment?

03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:23.520
This isn't a screen share,

03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:28.160
but something that I used to do when playing...

03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:29.040
Okay, so this is like...

03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:34.800
Back in the day when we used a program called Ventrilo,

03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:39.200
this is far before the discords of the world,

03:16:39.200 --> 03:16:41.680
but it's essentially discord, but a super long time ago.

03:16:41.680 --> 03:16:42.560
Cool kids used mumble.

03:16:44.560 --> 03:16:44.960
Go on.

03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:48.240
But there was a run flag that you could put on Ventrilo

03:16:48.240 --> 03:16:49.680
so you could open more than one of them.

03:16:50.320 --> 03:16:52.320
You could join two different servers at the same time.

03:16:53.200 --> 03:16:55.440
And if you set up your keybinds in a certain way,

03:16:55.440 --> 03:16:56.080
Uh-oh.

03:16:56.080 --> 03:17:00.720
You could mic up for one of them and not mic up for the other one.

03:17:00.720 --> 03:17:04.240
So if you're playing classic WoW in 2004,

03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:09.440
and you and your buddies are in a raid with 40 other people,

03:17:09.440 --> 03:17:12.640
and you want to be in the comms for the main raid

03:17:12.640 --> 03:17:14.400
because you're supposed to be here or whatever,

03:17:14.400 --> 03:17:17.040
and then you want to be in comms with just you and your friends

03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:22.080
so you can talk trash or do whatever,

03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:26.640
pressing the wrong keybind and saying something could be bad.

03:17:27.200 --> 03:17:27.440
Right.

03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:28.960
Yep, and that happened.

03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:30.320
Sick.

03:17:33.200 --> 03:17:36.160
I actually can't really think of anything right now.

03:17:36.960 --> 03:17:37.760
I've definitely-

03:17:37.760 --> 03:17:40.080
Bad screen shares, could leak stuff on WAN.

03:17:40.080 --> 03:17:40.720
Oh, yeah.

03:17:40.720 --> 03:17:42.320
Oh, okay, that was pretty good.

03:17:42.320 --> 03:17:42.800
Oh, yeah.

03:17:42.800 --> 03:17:45.600
Yeah, there was the time that I leaked everyone's salaries.

03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:49.280
Yep.

03:17:49.280 --> 03:17:50.000
How ironic.

03:17:52.080 --> 03:17:55.200
Okay, let's move on.

03:17:57.040 --> 03:17:58.960
Back to potentials that the only curator got.

03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:01.040
Okay.

03:18:01.760 --> 03:18:04.640
Sean asks, we just celebrated our dog's first birthday.

03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:06.480
Might be a little spoiled.

03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:09.520
Do y'all celebrate birthdays or got ya days for your pets?

03:18:11.920 --> 03:18:13.040
No, not personally.

03:18:14.720 --> 03:18:15.680
Me either.

03:18:15.680 --> 03:18:17.360
I actually don't know how old Dash is.

03:18:18.320 --> 03:18:23.360
And there's no excuse because we knew when she was born at some point.

03:18:24.320 --> 03:18:26.480
Just like, I don't know, she's a cat.

03:18:27.600 --> 03:18:31.120
I love her, but she's a kitty.

03:18:32.080 --> 03:18:32.720
How old is she?

03:18:33.680 --> 03:18:34.000
Cat?

03:18:35.440 --> 03:18:35.840
Kitty?

03:18:36.400 --> 03:18:36.640
Yeah.

03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:42.960
Emma likes to tell the story where I was hanging out with her family and one of her family members

03:18:42.960 --> 03:18:49.200
asked me how young my brother's daughter was, and I said, under a year old.

03:18:53.440 --> 03:18:56.800
Yeah, Luke and I are not particularly detail-oriented people.

03:18:58.880 --> 03:19:01.600
Speaking of which, Mother's Day is coming, two-week warning.

03:19:03.920 --> 03:19:07.200
For those of you out there who are also not particularly detail-oriented.

03:19:10.720 --> 03:19:12.720
I'm going to put that in my calendar immediately.

03:19:12.720 --> 03:19:14.800
I didn't know anything was wrong with that response.

03:19:14.800 --> 03:19:17.120
Everyone looked at me weird and I was just like, what?

03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:19.680
And then she ended up informing me later that like...

03:19:19.680 --> 03:19:21.920
Yeah, it's in months at this point.

03:19:21.920 --> 03:19:22.640
Everyone does months.

03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:25.520
Up until about 24 months, everyone does months.

03:19:25.520 --> 03:19:27.440
Because the development is so fast.

03:19:27.440 --> 03:19:29.040
Yeah, sure, that makes sense.

03:19:34.800 --> 03:19:35.760
Any more on potential?

03:19:36.880 --> 03:19:38.480
I mean, I might as well just read one, too.

03:19:38.480 --> 03:19:40.240
Yeah, just find ones to read.

03:19:40.240 --> 03:19:42.240
I already scrolled here.

03:19:44.640 --> 03:19:47.200
Let's see, we're going back to our headline topic.

03:19:47.200 --> 03:19:50.400
What should they have done to foster more Canadian content creators?

03:19:51.360 --> 03:19:52.320
Fund it.

03:19:52.320 --> 03:19:56.720
Like, I'm not against funding content, but there's got to be a process for

03:19:58.080 --> 03:20:04.400
either taking content that's starting to snowball and trying to pour gas on the fire,

03:20:04.400 --> 03:20:09.280
or finding people that are in some kind of...

03:20:13.040 --> 03:20:14.000
Yeah, I guess...

03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:17.440
Okay, I guess for me, I'm not that into handouts.

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:25.120
So, finding people or organizations who are already trying and seeing a little bit of success,

03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:30.400
like have gotten the ball rolling a little bit and trying to get balls rolling faster,

03:20:30.400 --> 03:20:32.800
I guess, is where I'd like to see it.

03:20:32.800 --> 03:20:36.400
I don't think that it should be going to giant-established media companies,

03:20:36.400 --> 03:20:39.600
and I don't think it should be going to people who can't even be arsed to,

03:20:39.600 --> 03:20:42.640
you know, try turning on their selfie camera and recording something.

03:20:42.640 --> 03:20:43.760
I think there's a middle ground there.

03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:49.280
Okay, here's another one.

03:20:49.280 --> 03:20:51.120
Jobrolls say Canada only.

03:20:51.120 --> 03:20:52.720
Is that a hard requirement?

03:20:52.720 --> 03:20:55.040
Was looking at the roles and felt like I had the experience,

03:20:55.040 --> 03:20:56.320
but I'm UK-based.

03:20:56.320 --> 03:20:59.120
Would happily relocate given political reasons?

03:20:59.120 --> 03:21:03.280
I was typing out a response to this.

03:21:03.280 --> 03:21:06.640
Not all of the jobrolls say Canada only,

03:21:07.280 --> 03:21:09.120
because some of them are not Canada only.

03:21:09.920 --> 03:21:15.520
There are developer positions that are open to non-Canadian remote work.

03:21:15.520 --> 03:21:22.080
The ones that do say Canada only, you need to currently, right now,

03:21:22.080 --> 03:21:28.720
and there's a lot of people that, in my opinion, intentionally misinterpret this,

03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:32.240
but you need to currently, this exact second,

03:21:32.240 --> 03:21:35.760
need to legally be able to have a job in Canada.

03:21:35.760 --> 03:21:40.000
I do not mean you are eligible to apply for immigration.

03:21:41.040 --> 03:21:45.440
I mean, you are already legally able to have a job in Canada.

03:21:45.440 --> 03:21:47.840
That is possible without being a Canadian citizen.

03:21:49.760 --> 03:21:52.720
Almost all the time, it's going to mean that you live here already.

03:21:52.720 --> 03:21:56.320
Not technically though, so there is that window of opportunity.

03:21:56.640 --> 03:21:58.960
You can be a Canadian citizen who's living abroad.

03:22:00.480 --> 03:22:02.880
There are other weird work visas.

03:22:02.880 --> 03:22:05.200
Yeah, Dennis had a work visa because he went to school here.

03:22:05.200 --> 03:22:06.880
Yeah, there's other situations where it might-

03:22:06.880 --> 03:22:10.320
Even that ended up being a nightmare and costing a lot of money and taking a lot of time.

03:22:10.320 --> 03:22:14.160
So it will very likely hurt chances.

03:22:15.040 --> 03:22:15.920
I don't know.

03:22:17.440 --> 03:22:21.760
It's a huge nightmare if you don't already have the ability to work here.

03:22:22.240 --> 03:22:23.920
So, yeah.

03:22:23.920 --> 03:22:29.360
Unless, like I already said, the role doesn't say that and is open to working from outside of the country.

03:22:30.640 --> 03:22:32.720
What are you going to go see opening night?

03:22:32.720 --> 03:22:34.240
Barbie or Oppenheimer?

03:22:34.960 --> 03:22:36.800
Barbie, no question.

03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:39.680
And neither actually, but Barbie.

03:22:43.440 --> 03:22:44.240
Why not both?

03:22:44.240 --> 03:22:44.800
Double feature.

03:22:46.080 --> 03:22:48.560
I don't go to- and neither of us really go to movies that often.

03:22:48.560 --> 03:22:49.040
No.

03:22:49.040 --> 03:22:52.240
Yeah, I saw the Super Mario movie just because my family wanted to go.

03:22:52.240 --> 03:22:52.880
Yeah.

03:22:52.880 --> 03:22:59.440
And actually they only wanted to go because an other family invited us to go because they were taking their kids.

03:22:59.440 --> 03:23:02.000
So I got dragged along by dragalongs.

03:23:03.520 --> 03:23:06.560
It's the only reason I saw it in the theater, otherwise I would have just watched it at home.

03:23:06.560 --> 03:23:10.240
My favorite thing about watching movies in the last like while has been

03:23:10.880 --> 03:23:16.640
when Linus and I go, which is extremely uncommon, and the actual favorite part about it

03:23:16.640 --> 03:23:20.640
is when we just like sit in the car afterwards and talk the whole movie.

03:23:23.200 --> 03:23:27.840
Which like, if that's the reason you're going, it's almost never going to be worth going.

03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:30.000
Which Star Wars movie did we do that for?

03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:30.560
I don't remember.

03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:32.480
I can't remember, but it was awful.

03:23:34.080 --> 03:23:36.240
I don't- was it the first one?

03:23:36.880 --> 03:23:37.280
No.

03:23:37.280 --> 03:23:38.560
No, I don't think so.

03:23:38.560 --> 03:23:39.440
It must have been the second one.

03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:40.560
Must have been the second one.

03:23:40.560 --> 03:23:40.960
Yeah.

03:23:40.960 --> 03:23:46.400
Because it was- you know, pretty much every week I get into it with David.

03:23:47.120 --> 03:23:51.440
About Stupid, The Last Skywalker or whatever that stupid movie is called.

03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:57.760
He's like, it went places with storytelling and creativity.

03:23:57.760 --> 03:24:00.880
I'm just like, I know David doesn't have a movie podcast anymore,

03:24:00.880 --> 03:24:02.480
so he doesn't have a way to defend himself.

03:24:03.280 --> 03:24:05.920
Well, no, actually, does he still have one?

03:24:05.920 --> 03:24:06.960
I think he does.

03:24:06.960 --> 03:24:07.760
Is it movies still?

03:24:07.760 --> 03:24:08.000
I don't know.

03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:10.160
He definitely has a podcast still, but it's not here.

03:24:11.040 --> 03:24:16.320
Anyway, the point is, so I'm definitely taking a cheap shot here, but no, David.

03:24:16.320 --> 03:24:16.960
It's awful.

03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:19.440
It's awful and made no sense.

03:24:19.440 --> 03:24:22.240
It just- it just did random things.

03:24:22.240 --> 03:24:25.440
It's the equivalent of, you know, elementary school kids being like,

03:24:25.440 --> 03:24:27.760
Mom, you know what would be cool if like this happened.

03:24:27.760 --> 03:24:29.120
Which one was this, the-

03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:31.600
This was the Ryan Johnson one, the middle one.

03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:32.480
So the middle one.

03:24:32.480 --> 03:24:35.040
Isn't that the one where they're like, they fly now?

03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:35.680
Yeah.

03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:37.600
Yeah, that line will always drive me nuts.

03:24:37.600 --> 03:24:38.480
They already flew.

03:24:39.440 --> 03:24:40.480
That's not a new thing.

03:24:40.480 --> 03:24:44.000
R2-D2 flew, depending on which headcanon you subscribe to.

03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:45.680
There's a lot of those at this point.

03:24:46.800 --> 03:24:47.520
Yeah.

03:24:47.520 --> 03:24:48.640
Maybe it was the third one.

03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:51.520
It must have been the third one that we went off on.

03:24:54.800 --> 03:24:56.560
Either way, I mean, they were both terrible.

03:24:56.560 --> 03:24:57.120
I don't remember.

03:24:57.120 --> 03:24:58.240
Whatever, I don't know what to say.

03:24:58.240 --> 03:24:58.480
Yeah.

03:25:02.240 --> 03:25:03.280
That was really loud.

03:25:04.720 --> 03:25:05.600
That knuckle crack.

03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:05.920
Yikes.

03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:06.240
Oh, sorry.

03:25:07.440 --> 03:25:07.920
Yikes.

03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:10.400
I'm still having a lot of issues with this joint.

03:25:10.400 --> 03:25:10.880
Oh, really?

03:25:10.880 --> 03:25:12.560
So it gets really tight very often.

03:25:12.560 --> 03:25:13.440
You tried rolling it?

03:25:13.520 --> 03:25:16.400
I might need to go get X-rays.

03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:18.480
There might be actually something wrong with the bone.

03:25:18.480 --> 03:25:21.120
Yeah, because it should have, if it was tendons or whatever,

03:25:21.120 --> 03:25:21.920
it should have healed by now.

03:25:21.920 --> 03:25:23.120
Anyways, it's fine.

03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:25.360
I got another curated here for you.

03:25:26.400 --> 03:25:26.880
All right.

03:25:26.880 --> 03:25:28.240
I have a two-year-old.

03:25:28.240 --> 03:25:32.320
How did you introduce your children to video games and computers?

03:25:35.280 --> 03:25:38.160
Honestly, we just kind of made it up as we went along.

03:25:38.800 --> 03:25:42.320
Some of it was out of laziness, so we would often give our phones

03:25:42.320 --> 03:25:44.960
to our son who woke up a lot earlier than us.

03:25:46.800 --> 03:25:50.240
But man, this was before I had YouTube Premium.

03:25:50.240 --> 03:25:51.200
It existed.

03:25:51.200 --> 03:25:52.480
It was just too cheap to pay for it.

03:25:53.200 --> 03:25:56.000
So he would wake me every time there was an ad,

03:25:56.720 --> 03:25:59.040
so it really didn't get me much extra sleep.

03:25:59.040 --> 03:26:03.760
But we would put on like Phonic Song and all these-

03:26:03.760 --> 03:26:04.640
Why would he wake you?

03:26:04.640 --> 03:26:07.760
Like, because he didn't have the motor skills or understanding to-

03:26:07.760 --> 03:26:08.720
To click skip?

03:26:08.720 --> 03:26:10.560
Yeah, he didn't get it yet.

03:26:10.560 --> 03:26:16.320
So I'm pretty sure that that channel, I forget what it's called,

03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:17.920
ABC123 or something.

03:26:17.920 --> 03:26:19.200
I don't remember what it's even called,

03:26:19.200 --> 03:26:21.040
but like Phonic Song, Phonic Song 2,

03:26:22.480 --> 03:26:25.760
I could probably still sing these songs like word for word,

03:26:25.760 --> 03:26:27.920
and it's been like eight years and traumatized.

03:26:27.920 --> 03:26:30.320
But I'm pretty sure that's a significant part of the reason

03:26:30.320 --> 03:26:33.440
that our firstborn read like extremely early.

03:26:34.880 --> 03:26:37.520
And like his numeracy is like still off the charts.

03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:41.920
So that's probably a predisposition at that point,

03:26:41.920 --> 03:26:43.440
but he read extremely early.

03:26:43.440 --> 03:26:44.400
It was really impressive.

03:26:44.960 --> 03:26:47.360
And so I have no regrets about that.

03:26:47.360 --> 03:26:51.360
As for like gaming though, we waited a long time.

03:26:51.360 --> 03:26:54.640
My rule for my kids has been you're not really allowed

03:26:54.640 --> 03:26:56.240
to play video games until you can read.

03:26:56.880 --> 03:27:00.720
A, because I don't think you need to play video games when you're two.

03:27:00.720 --> 03:27:03.200
And B, because I don't want to help you.

03:27:03.200 --> 03:27:08.640
I don't want to just stand there and like help you navigate a menu or like

03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:13.040
help you figure out what's going on when you're supposed to be like

03:27:13.040 --> 03:27:14.800
talking to another character or whatever else.

03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:18.800
We, right now our system is we make them trade,

03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:22.960
developing their minds in some other way for video game time.

03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:24.320
So I think it's a two to one trade.

03:27:24.320 --> 03:27:28.480
So I think if you do half an hour of actual piano practice,

03:27:28.480 --> 03:27:30.080
then you get an hour of gaming time.

03:27:30.080 --> 03:27:31.440
Not just bonking keys.

03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:34.640
Yep. You have to actually be working on what your teacher said to work on.

03:27:34.640 --> 03:27:37.520
And there's a couple of other things that you can trade for video game time.

03:27:38.240 --> 03:27:41.040
And it seems to work reasonably well for us right now.

03:27:41.040 --> 03:27:43.200
It's a bit of a pain to keep track of.

03:27:43.200 --> 03:27:46.880
Yeah. But overall, I'm pretty happy.

03:27:46.880 --> 03:27:51.360
My kids, you know, aren't completely ignorant to technology,

03:27:51.360 --> 03:27:54.160
but they're also just not constantly glued to the boob tube.

03:27:54.160 --> 03:27:56.560
So cool.

03:27:56.560 --> 03:28:02.080
So you find when you're not editing.

03:28:03.040 --> 03:28:06.000
Do you have any experience with polo alto firewalls?

03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:07.040
If so, what are your thoughts?

03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:09.200
No. Nope.

03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:12.560
Any news on shipping for European customers?

03:28:12.560 --> 03:28:13.840
I thought you mentioned a while back,

03:28:13.840 --> 03:28:16.480
you might be looking to make it a better experience.

03:28:16.480 --> 03:28:19.360
We'd love to. We'd still love to.

03:28:20.320 --> 03:28:22.800
It's still complicated and still expensive.

03:28:22.800 --> 03:28:24.880
And we still have a lot of other things to work on.

03:28:25.520 --> 03:28:26.400
Sorry.

03:28:26.400 --> 03:28:29.920
Any updates on products that are under development or that you're excited about?

03:28:31.200 --> 03:28:34.080
Oh, um, don't leak too much.

03:28:34.080 --> 03:28:36.720
Oh, yeah. Stick locks are coming really soon.

03:28:37.280 --> 03:28:38.640
That's really exciting.

03:28:38.640 --> 03:28:40.160
There's a little joystick covers.

03:28:40.160 --> 03:28:41.600
Oh, those. Yeah.

03:28:41.600 --> 03:28:43.600
Yeah, those should be launched like imminently.

03:28:44.160 --> 03:28:45.600
Really excited for those.

03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:46.960
Didn't even know we were developing those.

03:28:46.960 --> 03:28:47.920
Yeah, they're really cool.

03:28:48.560 --> 03:28:51.120
I have decided to change course in my career

03:28:51.120 --> 03:28:54.160
and I'm going into a coding boot camp soon.

03:28:54.160 --> 03:28:55.840
Pursuing software engineering.

03:28:55.840 --> 03:28:58.560
Do you know anyone that has done something similar and found success?

03:28:59.680 --> 03:29:00.560
Luke, this one's for you.

03:29:02.240 --> 03:29:05.360
So they went to a boot camp and now they want a career?

03:29:05.360 --> 03:29:06.800
They're going to a boot camp.

03:29:06.800 --> 03:29:07.440
Yeah.

03:29:07.440 --> 03:29:09.520
And they're wondering if this is a good move.

03:29:10.720 --> 03:29:12.160
Yeah, but it's a very...

03:29:15.360 --> 03:29:16.640
It's not...

03:29:16.640 --> 03:29:20.400
It's much more similar to training yourself online, in my opinion,

03:29:20.400 --> 03:29:23.280
than it is to going and getting a degree.

03:29:23.280 --> 03:29:27.920
Because by doing that boot camp, you're kind of like using this thing

03:29:28.720 --> 03:29:31.360
to try to help move you along the path,

03:29:33.040 --> 03:29:36.240
believing that your first steps are important to be guided.

03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:38.480
That's, in my opinion, the way that you should take it.

03:29:38.480 --> 03:29:45.520
So from there, you still kind of need to build a good portfolio because...

03:29:48.560 --> 03:29:51.360
Just having like a lot of boot camps are various lengths.

03:29:51.360 --> 03:29:52.480
So I don't know how long that one is.

03:29:52.480 --> 03:29:57.680
But if you're like, I have a two-month boot camp, that's going to mean effectively nothing to me

03:29:57.680 --> 03:29:59.040
if I'm trying to hire you.

03:29:59.040 --> 03:30:02.240
But if you're like, I have a two-month boot camp, you can kind of ignore that part.

03:30:02.240 --> 03:30:03.920
My portfolio is really cool.

03:30:03.920 --> 03:30:05.200
Look at these things.

03:30:05.200 --> 03:30:06.080
That can mean a lot.

03:30:07.040 --> 03:30:11.440
I know a few other hiring people, if someone has a degree, at least a bachelor's,

03:30:11.440 --> 03:30:16.000
four-year degree, that's kind of like a check mark to move them forward.

03:30:16.000 --> 03:30:20.960
And things that equate with that are often portfolio or experience.

03:30:20.960 --> 03:30:23.200
Not some boot camp thing.

03:30:23.200 --> 03:30:26.480
So use the boot camp to make something cool.

03:30:26.480 --> 03:30:28.960
And then you can get there.

03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:33.760
Hi, Luke and Linus.

03:30:34.400 --> 03:30:36.560
Since you have started producing your own physical products,

03:30:36.560 --> 03:30:39.360
how has your experience with other physical products

03:30:39.360 --> 03:30:42.160
influenced your design or development of digital products?

03:30:46.240 --> 03:30:48.000
Those teams don't work together.

03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:48.800
I guess you do.

03:30:49.520 --> 03:30:50.800
No, I don't think I read that wrong.

03:30:50.800 --> 03:30:52.960
How has your experience with physical products

03:30:52.960 --> 03:30:56.640
influenced your design or development of digital ones?

03:30:56.640 --> 03:30:57.920
Physical to digital.

03:30:57.920 --> 03:30:58.640
I don't know.

03:30:58.640 --> 03:31:05.520
I mean, for me, it's always just...

03:31:08.480 --> 03:31:11.840
We're very thankful that the customer support isn't as hard for digital ones.

03:31:12.480 --> 03:31:14.880
Yeah, I mean, that's really good.

03:31:17.120 --> 03:31:20.000
The only person that crosses those team lines is Linus.

03:31:21.040 --> 03:31:25.360
Yeah, I mean, so much of our development is just how I would want it to be.

03:31:27.360 --> 03:31:31.280
And so that's the same whether it's a digital product or a physical product.

03:31:31.280 --> 03:31:32.000
That is true.

03:31:33.840 --> 03:31:34.160
Yeah.

03:31:36.720 --> 03:31:39.600
Okay, I got a curated one here that's really cool.

03:31:40.880 --> 03:31:43.600
Completely blind LTT viewer here.

03:31:43.600 --> 03:31:45.520
Love the WAN show for my tech news.

03:31:45.520 --> 03:31:49.440
What are your thoughts on the rise of the accessible games for the blind,

03:31:49.440 --> 03:31:50.960
such as the new Forza?

03:31:50.960 --> 03:31:53.360
Well, I might be biased, but cool stuff.

03:31:53.360 --> 03:31:54.160
How do they do that?

03:31:54.160 --> 03:31:57.120
It has some really cool features that just make it more...

03:31:58.480 --> 03:31:58.960
No way.

03:31:59.840 --> 03:32:02.160
Like, I think there's a high contrast mode.

03:32:02.800 --> 03:32:06.000
Oh, so it includes legally blind, so you can still see a little bit.

03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:09.440
Microsoft has done a lot.

03:32:09.440 --> 03:32:10.000
They don't do everything right.

03:32:10.000 --> 03:32:10.640
Absolutely.

03:32:11.760 --> 03:32:14.400
But they've done a lot to push accessible gaming forward.

03:32:14.400 --> 03:32:15.520
Yes, that's super cool.

03:32:15.520 --> 03:32:17.360
Every time we talk about it, we're just like,

03:32:18.320 --> 03:32:18.720
yes.

03:32:19.360 --> 03:32:20.000
Great work.

03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:20.560
Do that.

03:32:20.560 --> 03:32:21.120
Do more.

03:32:24.800 --> 03:32:26.160
We're all a little different.

03:32:26.160 --> 03:32:30.160
And whether your difference is obvious from the outside or not,

03:32:31.120 --> 03:32:38.240
I think gaming is one of the ways that people of all types can come together and enjoy their time together.

03:32:38.240 --> 03:32:40.480
I mean, we did an executive retreat recently.

03:32:41.440 --> 03:32:41.680
And...

03:32:41.680 --> 03:32:42.560
Make it quick.

03:32:42.560 --> 03:32:43.200
Yeah.

03:32:43.200 --> 03:32:46.640
One of the big highlights for me was just all playing games together.

03:32:47.920 --> 03:32:52.960
You know, I think it's a very old fashioned outlook to think of video games as,

03:32:54.000 --> 03:32:56.880
you know, the bad for you, rot your brain or whatever.

03:32:56.880 --> 03:32:58.240
It's a social experience, right?

03:32:58.240 --> 03:33:01.840
I don't think it's any different from playing a board game necessarily.

03:33:01.840 --> 03:33:02.720
It can be.

03:33:02.720 --> 03:33:03.760
But it doesn't have to be.

03:33:03.760 --> 03:33:08.720
And I think that making that experience more inclusive is a noble goal and one that

03:33:09.440 --> 03:33:13.040
might not make sense financially, but that shouldn't matter.

03:33:13.040 --> 03:33:14.720
You should just do it anyway.

03:33:14.720 --> 03:33:18.080
I have deeply respected Microsoft's efforts in this regard.

03:33:18.080 --> 03:33:21.200
I'm not surprised it's happening to Forza because that's a Microsoft title.

03:33:21.200 --> 03:33:26.080
Their accessibility controller, I don't believe it's called that, but whatever it's called is

03:33:27.600 --> 03:33:30.880
like actually an incredible piece of hardware.

03:33:30.880 --> 03:33:35.280
And the fact that they still support it and make it and all that kind of stuff is just wildly cool.

03:33:37.120 --> 03:33:39.040
Okay, I've got another curated one here.

03:33:39.040 --> 03:33:40.320
Hi, LLD.

03:33:40.320 --> 03:33:44.880
I've been with my significant other for four years and plan on proposing soon.

03:33:44.880 --> 03:33:47.280
Do you have any advice for picking a ring?

03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:49.120
P.S., go full plane.

03:33:51.680 --> 03:33:53.040
I'm going to be honest with you.

03:33:53.040 --> 03:34:01.040
I am not the kind of person who makes major decisions without my wife.

03:34:01.760 --> 03:34:04.720
And the ring was a major decision.

03:34:04.720 --> 03:34:08.960
I mean, that was a really significant amount of money for us, especially at the time.

03:34:08.960 --> 03:34:15.600
And not even just the money, but the way to do it, whether it's like a metal ring or whether it's

03:34:16.400 --> 03:34:19.840
tattoos or whether we even want rings at all.

03:34:20.720 --> 03:34:23.680
And if you're gearing up to spend the rest of your lives together,

03:34:23.680 --> 03:34:28.400
I think that it's probably a good habit to get into, to talk to each other

03:34:28.400 --> 03:34:32.480
and work together on a solution that makes you both happy.

03:34:32.480 --> 03:34:39.440
So the answer would be to not ask me, but to show a genuine interest

03:34:39.440 --> 03:34:47.520
and work with your wife or SO or whatever title you guys use for each other

03:34:47.520 --> 03:34:50.560
and find something that makes you both happy.

03:34:52.480 --> 03:34:56.240
Okay, we've got our last six here if you guys want to push through them.

03:34:57.200 --> 03:34:58.640
I hear the pain in his voice.

03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:01.600
And now you don't have to, you can see it on his face.

03:35:03.440 --> 03:35:05.920
I'm okay. I don't want to get yelled at anymore.

03:35:07.200 --> 03:35:11.760
Hey Linus, I love your commitment to quality in LTT products and that you'd rather do it

03:35:11.760 --> 03:35:13.920
right and not do it at all. Or not do it at all.

03:35:13.920 --> 03:35:16.080
Or change the meaning there, Dan.

03:35:16.800 --> 03:35:21.360
Okay, sorry. I got to like have it wider so that I can actually parse these easier.

03:35:22.480 --> 03:35:26.880
Is there anything you credit to? Upringing, etc. I wish this was more common.

03:35:28.240 --> 03:35:29.440
You butchered that, man.

03:35:29.440 --> 03:35:31.760
Jesus. Let's try that again.

03:35:31.760 --> 03:35:34.160
Sure. Let's just do that one more time.

03:35:34.160 --> 03:35:38.320
One more time. Hey Linus, I love your commitment to quality in LTT products

03:35:38.320 --> 03:35:41.280
and that you'd rather do it right or not do it at all.

03:35:41.280 --> 03:35:45.760
Is there anything you credit this to? Your upbringing, etc. I wish this was more common.

03:35:46.320 --> 03:35:49.920
I'm a cheapskate and I hate wasting money.

03:35:49.920 --> 03:35:57.280
And I consider anything that breaks too fast or sucks for how much I paid for it is a bad value.

03:35:57.280 --> 03:35:59.120
I consider that to be a waste of money.

03:35:59.120 --> 03:36:02.240
And if I don't like wasting my own money, then I have to assume that you don't like

03:36:02.240 --> 03:36:05.280
wasting money either. I would toss in an additional argument,

03:36:06.160 --> 03:36:10.400
which is that he's going to extensively use anything that we make.

03:36:10.960 --> 03:36:13.680
If we make shirts, he's going to have to wear them like all the time.

03:36:13.680 --> 03:36:17.600
Literally every day. I'm also lazy and I hate rebuying things.

03:36:18.320 --> 03:36:23.360
So if I can have something that just lasts for a very long time, that makes me much happier.

03:36:23.360 --> 03:36:28.080
Yeah. So I hate wasting money and I hate wasting time and I consider bad products to be a waste

03:36:28.080 --> 03:36:29.280
of money and time. Yeah.

03:36:31.040 --> 03:36:34.560
I recently went back and played my childhood favorite, the Wii.

03:36:34.560 --> 03:36:38.240
That's when I realized the graphics and tracking were a lot worse than I remember.

03:36:38.240 --> 03:36:41.360
Yeah. What's your, wow, this is actually garbage moment.

03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:47.760
Huh. Mine's so generic. I can do it, but it's so generic.

03:36:47.760 --> 03:36:51.600
Yeah, do it. I went back to go play Morrowind like over a decade later.

03:36:51.600 --> 03:36:53.200
How many times do you use all that story? I know.

03:36:53.200 --> 03:36:56.080
Tell a better story. I told you it's generic.

03:36:56.080 --> 03:37:01.680
Wow. This was actually garbage. I don't know. The nostalgia filter is so strong.

03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:05.600
Like I went back and played one of the Hugo games, Hugo's House of Horrors.

03:37:06.320 --> 03:37:12.720
And it's objectively bad. The graphics are terrible. The gameplay, it's like, it's,

03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:19.600
it's got like a graphical interface, but it's really a text adventure game.

03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:23.360
And you know, the problem with text adventure games is that without the benefit of a large

03:37:23.360 --> 03:37:28.720
language model or something like that, you often have to just, you have to just sit there

03:37:29.680 --> 03:37:39.200
and find, yeah, the exact right way to steal key, take key, put arm through a hole and remove key.

03:37:40.800 --> 03:37:46.880
It was very frustrating, but I still, I kind of get joy from it.

03:37:47.440 --> 03:37:52.560
And if anything, more now than I did back then, now that I can just look up the answers on the

03:37:52.560 --> 03:37:56.560
internet and see what happened with this stupid game, I could never beat as a kid because it was

03:37:56.560 --> 03:38:03.680
impossible. You know, it's a weird thing for me. My nostalgia glasses for graphics are not that

03:38:03.680 --> 03:38:07.120
bad. Like when I went back to war, when I was like, yeah, this is how I remember looking,

03:38:07.120 --> 03:38:11.600
whatever. When I go back to super old games, I'm never like, oh, I can't believe it's so bad.

03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:17.280
I always remember how it looks. It's the controls. You know what? Oh yeah, controls. Oh, okay. Yeah,

03:38:17.280 --> 03:38:22.880
that's one. 007. Yeah. Like you go and play 007 and you're just like, oh man, like, yeah,

03:38:22.880 --> 03:38:27.680
this is rough. Actually, my character is brutal. It's not the graphics. No wonder, you know,

03:38:27.680 --> 03:38:33.280
going to my friend's house and playing, like he always beat me up. Like you have to train

03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:38.880
in order to operate this thing. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'd say old control schemes.

03:38:40.320 --> 03:38:44.640
Yeah. Cause like it took a while for people to figure out like, okay, yeah, this is how

03:38:44.640 --> 03:38:49.840
shooters are going to work. Yeah. Like didn't the original Unreal tournament use like A and Z

03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:55.840
for look up and down? Something like that? Oh, I don't know. Original UT controls. Yeah. Cause

03:38:55.840 --> 03:39:03.600
I mean, looking vertically was not a thing that was a feature on a initial shooter game. Yeah,

03:39:03.600 --> 03:39:10.480
mouse look, not a thing. Yeah. Like a lot of old shooter games, when you got to a ramp,

03:39:10.480 --> 03:39:14.480
your character would just like look up it automatically. Like you didn't actually control

03:39:14.480 --> 03:39:22.000
that or the planes were all actually like equal. So if something was up a ramp, if you shot

03:39:22.800 --> 03:39:26.800
what would hit the ramp, but in the right direction, your bullets would just like go up

03:39:27.840 --> 03:39:32.640
and hit them. Yeah. No, here we go. When playing Unreal tournament, I barely use the mouse unless

03:39:32.640 --> 03:39:40.160
I'm sniping. All my controls are in the keyboard. Control is fire, space bar, alt fire, alt for

03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:49.200
walk, A to jump, Z to crouch, page up to look up, page down to look down, home to center the view,

03:39:49.200 --> 03:39:56.000
Q to throw the weapon that you're holding and W to throw a relic. This is just a forum post I found

03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:06.000
in UT99.org. And so a lot of people are posting these just like by modern standards, utterly

03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:17.760
ridiculous. Yeah. All right. That's rough. Yeah. Page up and page down. Okay.

03:40:20.080 --> 03:40:26.560
Yeah. Hey, when the audio only WAN show gets released, will it be live and where could people

03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:32.800
listen to it? Spotify maybe? It'll be here. It'll be here. Yeah. As like a VOD. Yeah. Not live and here.

03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:38.720
With the couple of remote control things that you have done, I found your channel from the fire

03:40:38.720 --> 03:40:44.480
truck lol. Would you consider a shelf model train layout around your house considering a DCC setup

03:40:44.480 --> 03:40:52.880
is very tech advanced? I have wanted to do, I actually wanted to build like a like a ceiling

03:40:52.880 --> 03:40:59.040
suspended train in the kids room just for kind of a fun project. It's basically since my first

03:40:59.040 --> 03:41:07.040
child was born. Well, that's a decade ago now. It hasn't happened yet. So I'm thinking probably

03:41:07.040 --> 03:41:14.320
it's not going to happen at this point. It's super cool. But I just I can't find the motivation to

03:41:14.320 --> 03:41:19.200
do it. When if I'm going to put a bunch of things on the wall or up around the ceiling, I think the

03:41:19.200 --> 03:41:24.640
way for me to go now is a bunch of like cat perches and cat runs and stuff like that. I'd love to do

03:41:24.640 --> 03:41:32.800
that in our house. Oh, sorry. I was getting angry messages. Finally got my stream deck, suggest

03:41:32.800 --> 03:41:39.440
some Wii games for the emulator, please. Wii games on the steam deck. Given how prevalent

03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:44.800
motion controls were for the Wii, I don't think I have a ton of suggestions. The vast majority of

03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:53.200
my Wii time was Wii sports, actually. Like vast majority. I bought other games, but Wii sports

03:41:53.760 --> 03:41:58.880
came. I was typing out a response to that. But yeah, in my experience, all the games that I enjoyed

03:41:58.880 --> 03:42:05.520
with the Wii was because they got me up and got me moving. Wii sports stuff, what other various

03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:11.520
interesting control. The Wii was cool because it was a very new thing with the motion controller.

03:42:12.720 --> 03:42:16.960
That's why the Wii was cool. It wasn't cool because you could control the turn the controller

03:42:17.040 --> 03:42:24.560
sideways and play platformers. I'm going to curated one here, so this one's obviously

03:42:24.560 --> 03:42:31.280
important to line us. Luke, as a back-end developer myself, what is the business benefit for closed

03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:37.920
source code? In my experience, almost all code written had been done, had been done variation

03:42:37.920 --> 03:42:46.080
of something else that I've already done or exists. Okay. I mean, there's a lot of nebulous

03:42:46.080 --> 03:42:55.360
things. This isn't, yeah, this is a lot of people get really spicy about open source

03:42:55.360 --> 03:43:01.280
code stuff. They do. I was curious about your answer. I would bring us back to the Star Citizen

03:43:01.280 --> 03:43:05.440
conversation that I often bring up with these types of things, which is where you do stuff

03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:13.040
more in the light. You get tied up communicating about it instead of just like

03:43:13.840 --> 03:43:21.760
doing it. We have contributed to open source projects for things that we use. We want to do

03:43:21.760 --> 03:43:29.040
more and we'll probably scale up how much of that we do in the future. It takes a little bit more

03:43:29.040 --> 03:43:34.640
care than just editing it slightly for your own use case and then just running with it. It would

03:43:34.640 --> 03:43:38.240
take more time, but we do want to give back to those communities. Again, we have done it

03:43:38.880 --> 03:43:41.840
a certain amount already, but we do wish to do it more in the future.

03:43:48.160 --> 03:43:54.880
The idea that just having open source code means these magical angel developers are just

03:43:54.880 --> 03:44:00.080
going to come out of nowhere and just do things for you, which is the way that it's communicated

03:44:00.080 --> 03:44:06.560
surprisingly often, is not real. There are benefits to open source code. People can find,

03:44:06.640 --> 03:44:11.360
especially security problems and suggest things. If they start using it, they might

03:44:11.360 --> 03:44:16.000
contribute features and a lot of stuff like that. If you look into the space, it ends up being

03:44:18.320 --> 03:44:25.760
a maintainer or a small group of maintainers just needing to fix things for other people

03:44:26.880 --> 03:44:29.440
and spending a lot of the time dealing with that type of stuff.

03:44:30.160 --> 03:44:37.200
I think that's honestly most of it. I'm not worried so much about like,

03:44:37.200 --> 03:44:40.960
oh, someone got our code for whatever. They can do the same thing we're doing. That's not

03:44:40.960 --> 03:44:44.800
really the problem. It's just not the most efficient way of moving forward.

03:44:44.800 --> 03:44:47.120
Sorry, Domenico. Probably not anytime soon.

03:44:52.080 --> 03:44:56.720
That's going to piss some people off. A bunch of open source people might get mad,

03:44:56.800 --> 03:45:00.160
but I don't know. I think the open source community is fantastic and we have made

03:45:00.160 --> 03:45:03.920
contributions. We will make more contributions in the future, but it's not efficient for us

03:45:03.920 --> 03:45:09.280
to just open source everything and then deal with this insane deluge of incoming communication

03:45:09.280 --> 03:45:16.880
about all of it. We're a very small team and there could be benefits because we are a very

03:45:16.880 --> 03:45:21.040
small team to opening it and that's great. Maybe we'll make something that's open at some point.

03:45:21.040 --> 03:45:25.520
There's been a few proposals internally like, hey, we're making this one tool. This might be a good

03:45:25.520 --> 03:45:29.280
idea to open source at some point, especially there's been communication around that

03:45:30.080 --> 03:45:32.800
with some of the lab stuff and maybe that will be a thing.

03:45:36.800 --> 03:45:44.400
But it's not a thing right now. And with that, the show is not a thing right now. Wow. Bye.

03:45:44.400 --> 03:45:58.960
Okay.

03:46:04.640 --> 03:46:09.840
Oh, we got one more message. Show is brought to you by MSI, Vessy, and Accuflow. Travis J says,

03:46:09.840 --> 03:46:15.920
receives my first t-shirt today. Best fit shirt I may have ever bought. Love it. Wow.

03:46:15.920 --> 03:46:28.480
But two more shirts. Excellent.
