WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
I bring a hat down by any chance.

00:02.880 --> 00:04.880
We should be live.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.360
I look freaking ridiculous.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.920
I think we both look just, to be honest.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.920
Yes!

00:10.920 --> 00:11.920
Oh, hat.

00:11.920 --> 00:12.920
Thank God.

00:12.920 --> 00:13.920
That does encourage things.

00:13.920 --> 00:14.920
What the hell is going on here?

00:14.920 --> 00:15.920
All right.

00:15.920 --> 00:16.920
Any other questions?

00:16.920 --> 00:17.920
Okay.

00:17.920 --> 00:18.920
When did you fly out?

00:18.920 --> 00:19.920
By the way.

00:19.920 --> 00:20.920
I don't know.

00:20.920 --> 00:21.920
Yeah, tonight.

00:21.920 --> 00:22.920
Okay.

00:22.920 --> 00:23.920
Yeah.

00:23.920 --> 00:28.920
So I fly out tonight and then I play badminton tonight.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.840
Some more.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.840
After being sore and also stuck on a plane for a long time.

00:34.840 --> 00:35.840
Yeah.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.840
I mean, it should be fine.

00:37.840 --> 00:38.840
Okay.

00:38.840 --> 00:43.840
So we should, I guess, ask the chat how it sounds.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.840
If there's any echo or slapback volumes.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.840
Slapback.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.840
Oh, God!

00:50.840 --> 00:51.840
Right in your face.

00:51.840 --> 00:52.840
Yeah.

00:52.840 --> 00:58.840
Sound is going to be weird.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.640
I mean, if people are complaining it's too loud, adjust nothing.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.960
Because the complaint is always that it's too quiet.

01:04.960 --> 01:07.840
So this will be a nice improvement.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.840
Wonderful.

01:10.840 --> 01:14.840
And then figure out how to make it louder all the time.

01:14.840 --> 01:15.840
Yeah.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.840
Apparently we can do it with like a $60 tabletop mic.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.840
Got him.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.840
Dad is dying.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.840
It's true though.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.840
This one does have auto gain leveling.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.840
Cool.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.840
Let's have that all the time for everything.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.840
I just turned up my auto gain leveler at the studio.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.840
Okay.

01:39.840 --> 01:43.840
Actually, we should, no, no, I'm in all seriousness.

01:43.840 --> 01:47.840
We should do more of like a show levels thing here.

01:47.840 --> 01:48.840
Okay.

01:48.840 --> 01:49.840
Welcome to the WAN show.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.840
It's going to be a great show for you guys this week.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.840
I can't believe they would do that.

01:53.840 --> 01:54.840
That's just clipping the whole time.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.840
I can't believe.

01:56.840 --> 01:57.840
Okay, well.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.840
The gain adjustment is not fast enough.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.840
Yeah.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.840
So let's get that adjusted then.

02:06.840 --> 02:07.840
Woo.

02:07.840 --> 02:11.840
Andy, could you handle that?

02:11.840 --> 02:14.840
Andy, we apparently need to turn the audio levels down.

02:14.840 --> 02:15.840
Wait, how is Andy supposed to do that?

02:15.840 --> 02:16.840
Yeah.

02:16.840 --> 02:17.840
What are you talking about?

02:17.840 --> 02:18.840
You know I can.

02:18.840 --> 02:22.840
It's an app that we were working in earlier.

02:22.840 --> 02:23.840
He says it's in the app.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.840
What?

02:24.840 --> 02:26.840
Well, isn't there just a dial on here?

02:26.840 --> 02:28.840
That might be for a headphone monitoring.

02:28.840 --> 02:29.840
Yeah.

02:29.840 --> 02:34.840
Okay.

02:34.840 --> 02:35.840
Road connect.

02:35.840 --> 02:36.840
Yeah.

02:36.840 --> 02:37.840
Road connect.

02:37.840 --> 02:38.840
You should have the.

02:38.840 --> 02:39.840
All right.

02:39.840 --> 02:40.840
Welcome to the WAN show.

02:40.840 --> 02:41.840
We got a great show for you guys this week.

02:41.840 --> 02:42.840
It's going to be flipping awesome.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.840
It's Computex WAN.

02:44.840 --> 02:45.840
Wait.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.840
Taiwan.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.840
Did you just turn down the slider?

02:48.840 --> 02:49.840
Because you have to turn down the gain.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.840
It's in the mic settings.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.840
Okay.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.840
Cause now it's just quieter and still clipping.

02:55.840 --> 02:56.840
Dan, he can't hear you.

02:56.840 --> 02:57.840
One moment please.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.840
Oh God. That's right.

03:00.840 --> 03:01.840
I'm going to cry.

03:01.840 --> 03:02.840
How is this?

03:02.840 --> 03:04.840
That's very annoying.

03:04.840 --> 03:05.840
What is this?

03:05.840 --> 03:09.840
I think it's got to be the hamburger.

03:09.840 --> 03:10.840
Channel assignment.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.840
I think it's preferences.

03:12.840 --> 03:13.840
Or system maybe.

03:13.840 --> 03:14.840
But I think.

03:14.840 --> 03:15.840
Okay.

03:15.840 --> 03:16.840
Reset, right?

03:16.840 --> 03:17.840
I'm kidding.

03:17.840 --> 03:18.840
I'm kidding.

03:18.840 --> 03:19.840
What?

03:19.840 --> 03:20.840
This is stupid.

03:20.840 --> 03:25.840
I'm trying.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.840
Linus, you'll be happy to know this is the time that I recommended

03:28.840 --> 03:31.840
a Go XLR.

03:31.840 --> 03:36.840
Well, I didn't say not to use a Go XLR.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.840
Yeah. Wait, who said no?

03:39.840 --> 03:42.840
Maybe I also said though that simplicity is good.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.840
And we used to do it with just a USB desktop mic.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.840
Yeah. I mean, that's a.

03:46.840 --> 03:47.840
So good.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.840
Do you know where in this dashboard the setting you're telling us to

03:49.840 --> 03:50.840
change is?

03:50.840 --> 03:51.840
Yeah.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.840
All we see is the slider, sir.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.840
You may have to like double click on one of the mics.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.840
Double click on a mic.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.840
Yeah.

04:00.840 --> 04:01.840
Oh my God.

04:01.840 --> 04:02.840
That is so stupid.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.840
And I think it's set to like 36 or something like now right now.

04:05.840 --> 04:06.840
We're on it.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.840
Yeah.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.840
All right.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.840
Welcome to the man show.

04:09.840 --> 04:10.840
Ladies and gentlemen.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.840
It's going to be a great show for you guys today.

04:12.840 --> 04:13.840
Let's just put that at 25.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.840
25 sounds good.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.840
It's going to be a good one.

04:17.840 --> 04:18.840
Show.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.840
There we are.

04:20.840 --> 04:21.840
Show.

04:21.840 --> 04:22.840
You're a little quiet.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.840
Bring up that slider after you've finished adjusting the game.

04:25.840 --> 04:26.840
So it doesn't clip anymore.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.840
Oh, just the slider.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.840
I refuse.

04:30.840 --> 04:31.840
Please.

04:31.840 --> 04:32.840
Do please.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.840
Sorry.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.840
Why do you want to slide it back up where you want it?

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
Just to that.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.840
I think so.

04:37.840 --> 04:38.840
Okay.

04:38.840 --> 04:39.840
You happy now?

04:39.840 --> 04:40.840
Another intro.

04:40.840 --> 04:41.840
You're clipping again.

04:41.840 --> 04:42.840
Yeah.

04:42.840 --> 04:43.840
What's up guys.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.840
Welcome to the WAN show.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.840
We've got a great show for you lined up today.

04:46.840 --> 04:47.840
Just kidding.

04:47.840 --> 04:48.840
That's a big lie.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.840
That's better.

04:50.840 --> 04:51.840
It'll be acceptable.

04:51.840 --> 04:52.840
It'll be acceptable.

04:52.840 --> 04:53.840
You'll accept it.

04:53.840 --> 04:57.840
WAN shows bar for acceptability is quite low.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.840
We both.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.840
We're trying Luke.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.840
Rude.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.840
Rude.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.840
Me.

05:09.840 --> 05:14.840
Yeah.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.840
All right, we good?

05:16.840 --> 05:17.840
Yeah.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.840
Very tolerable.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.840
I think this is tolerable.

05:20.840 --> 05:21.840
All right.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.840
It's as good as it's going to get.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.840
That's the bar.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.840
How long am I keeping you today?

05:28.840 --> 05:30.840
I'm not going to be able to give you 10 seconds.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.840
I'm not going to be able to keep you on track.

05:34.840 --> 05:35.840
Yeah, you can.

05:35.840 --> 05:36.840
I'm on teams.

05:36.840 --> 05:37.840
Okay. Perfect.

05:37.840 --> 05:42.840
Bye.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.840
What do you mean by are you?

05:44.840 --> 05:47.840
I think he was muting himself.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.840
That's what I did.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.840
Yeah.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.840
Because he can't like back channel talk to us anymore.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.840
So if he ever talks to stream, here's it.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.840
Yep.

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
Sick.

05:58.840 --> 05:59.840
Hell yeah.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.840
Hell yeah.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.840
Hell yeah.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.840
Oh man.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.840
I could have solved that if I had thought of it.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.840
We could have had like an air pod in one year connected to just like a

06:11.840 --> 06:13.840
teams call with Dan.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.840
And then we could have had the ping call in here.

06:15.840 --> 06:16.840
Yep.

06:16.840 --> 06:17.840
I thought about doing that with discord.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.840
Didn't really put together the teams part.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.840
That makes sense.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.840
I mean, yeah, I would have worked with this one.

06:23.840 --> 06:24.840
Do we want to do that?

06:24.840 --> 06:25.840
I have my efforts.

06:25.840 --> 06:26.840
No, I'm over it.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.840
I mean, do we really need to listen to Dan?

06:28.840 --> 06:29.840
Probably not.

06:29.840 --> 06:30.840
Sick.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.840
Got him.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.840
He can't even say anything back because we're about to start the show.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.840
And he might interrupt.

06:36.840 --> 06:43.840
Okay, we ready?

06:43.840 --> 06:45.840
Is this it?

06:45.840 --> 06:46.840
Yep.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.840
Or wait.

06:47.840 --> 06:48.840
Oh, you know what?

06:48.840 --> 06:49.840
Oh, okay.

06:49.840 --> 06:50.840
I can see this first.

06:50.840 --> 06:51.840
Yeah.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.840
I guess that's acceptable, isn't it?

06:53.840 --> 06:56.840
God, we look tired.

06:56.840 --> 06:57.840
Yeah.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.840
We look like actual ass.

06:59.840 --> 07:06.840
The ass show.

07:06.840 --> 07:07.840
Yeah.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.840
Plumber show.

07:12.840 --> 07:18.840
The cracks are forming.

07:18.840 --> 07:19.840
Okay.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.840
Should we just do it then?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.840
Yeah.

07:23.840 --> 07:27.840
Okay.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.840
All right, let's just do it.

07:30.840 --> 07:46.840
Okay.

07:46.840 --> 07:52.840
Because I am ADD and I got distracted.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.840
Same reason I'm ever doing anything.

07:56.840 --> 08:01.840
So Andy, I don't really think you have to hang out for this whole thing.

08:01.840 --> 08:02.840
Yeah.

08:02.840 --> 08:03.840
Yeah.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.840
Yeah.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.840
That's what I would do.

08:07.840 --> 08:12.840
That's what I would be motivated to do.

08:12.840 --> 08:13.840
Yeah.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.840
I am also pretty hungry.

08:16.840 --> 08:20.840
Are there any of those just like meat and cheese croissants or something?

08:20.840 --> 08:25.840
May I please have a meat and cheese croissant?

08:25.840 --> 08:30.840
Honestly, just like some water would be awesome.

08:30.840 --> 08:35.840
I feel like I drink as much as I possibly can while I'm here and I'm just a dried husk anyways.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.840
Oh, thank you.

08:38.840 --> 08:43.840
According to my scale, I lost half a pound last night.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.840
And that was with my room at 20.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.840
I don't understand what's going on with me here.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.840
Yeah.

08:48.840 --> 08:54.840
Well, there is some, there is some overnight weight loss that isn't just water.

08:54.840 --> 08:58.840
I mean, that's actually impossible.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.840
No, it's not.

09:00.840 --> 09:01.840
What is it?

09:01.840 --> 09:02.840
Like some quantum shit.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.840
CO2 through your breath and all those other stuff.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.840
Oh my God, that's got to be negligible.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.840
People say it's because I've said the same thing and people get after me about how it's inaccurate.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.840
So I'm like, okay, whatever.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.840
I don't know like what amount it is or anything like that.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.840
You burn calories.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.840
I mean, an energy is mass, right?

09:22.840 --> 09:23.840
Okay.

09:23.840 --> 09:24.840
You know what?

09:24.840 --> 09:25.840
I'm just going to start the thing.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.840
The heat generation.

09:26.840 --> 09:27.840
Yeah.

09:27.840 --> 09:28.840
There's like other stuff going on.

09:28.840 --> 09:33.840
It's not just water, but there is a significant water.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.840
So I'm looking at.

09:38.840 --> 09:48.840
Where?

09:48.840 --> 09:50.840
I never noticed that.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.840
That's amazing.

09:51.840 --> 09:52.840
Okay.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.840
All right.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.840
Let's just do this.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.840
Okay.

10:00.840 --> 10:09.840
I'm resuming the selected.

10:09.840 --> 10:16.840
Welcome to the WAN show, which is pretty much guaranteed to be a disaster today based on how the setup is gone.

10:16.840 --> 10:23.840
And the fact that there is, I mean, we can't deny what's here in between us today.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.840
Didn't notice that, but we're starting the show anyway.

10:27.840 --> 10:31.840
We have got a great show lined up for you guys.

10:31.840 --> 10:42.840
The big topics are I have finally been convinced to name and shame the pool company landscaping company that I've been using.

10:42.840 --> 10:47.840
And I'm going to be talking about, you know, why whole room water cooling.

10:47.840 --> 10:55.840
The second has been delayed and it's basically comes down to, I don't want to end up slandering anyone.

10:55.840 --> 11:00.840
So it basically comes down to, in my opinion, the way that they've handled the job.

11:00.840 --> 11:01.840
Allegedly.

11:01.840 --> 11:10.840
I also want to talk about why there's been almost no gaming hardware news in our LTT coverage of Computex.

11:10.840 --> 11:15.840
That was not an accident, but it also wasn't something I can avoid.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.840
Yeah.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.840
And so I'll explain that in a little bit more detail later.

11:18.840 --> 11:19.840
What else we got today?

11:19.840 --> 11:25.840
The Dolphin Steam launch has been postponed, probably indefinitely, but we'll dive into that later.

11:25.840 --> 11:34.840
And also speaking of no gaming news, NVIDIA maybe temporarily joined the $1 trillion club.

11:34.840 --> 11:35.840
$1 trillion.

11:35.840 --> 11:39.840
And they definitely did not get there through gaming GPUs.

11:40.840 --> 11:41.840
Take that gamers.

11:41.840 --> 11:46.840
I just realized I have absolutely no way of rolling the intro.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.840
Yeah, Dan's going to have to hit it.

11:48.840 --> 11:49.840
Sick.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.840
Hey.

12:10.840 --> 12:17.840
The show is brought to you today by something, presumably, I wasn't able to see it, but maybe

12:17.840 --> 12:18.840
you guys were.

12:18.840 --> 12:19.840
I'm getting there.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.840
Backblaze, Squarespace and Black Point Cyber.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.840
Thank you.

12:26.840 --> 12:31.840
It's been so long since we've done a WAN show on site like this.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.840
It's the Taiwan show, guys.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.840
And I'm absolutely here for it.

12:35.840 --> 12:40.840
Someone pointed out in the footprint chat that this is actually just a StarForge logo.

12:40.840 --> 12:41.840
Yes.

12:41.840 --> 12:42.840
It's okay.

12:42.840 --> 12:43.840
It's a hammer.

12:43.840 --> 12:44.840
Yeah.

12:44.840 --> 12:45.840
Yeah.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.840
Yeah.

12:46.840 --> 12:47.840
It's a hammer.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.840
It's a hammer.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.840
It's right between our heads.

12:50.840 --> 12:54.840
I am so sore right now and so tired.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.840
Guys, as tired as I look, that's how tired I am.

12:57.840 --> 13:04.840
I've actually spent more time playing badminton than actually like.

13:04.840 --> 13:09.840
I think we got, if we collected the amount of hours we slept last night, we had one full

13:09.840 --> 13:10.840
night of sleep.

13:10.840 --> 13:11.840
Yeah.

13:11.840 --> 13:12.840
Yeah.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.840
It was pretty rough.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.840
I played for like five hours yesterday and this is really bad.

13:16.840 --> 13:23.840
I realized when I got a group chat this morning from the center back home that I'm actually

13:23.840 --> 13:26.840
signed up to play badminton on Saturday again.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.840
Which is tonight.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.840
Which is tonight, but also I go back in time when I go home.

13:31.840 --> 13:37.840
So it's like far from now tonight, but I have played every day.

13:37.840 --> 13:41.840
Do you think you're going to crush when you go home even though you're sore because you're

13:41.840 --> 13:45.840
like so warmed up against good players?

13:45.840 --> 13:47.840
You saw me try to go downstairs last night.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.840
Yeah, but I saw you try to go downstairs the night before as well.

13:50.840 --> 13:51.840
Yeah.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.840
And then you found a way to play.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.840
Yeah.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.840
So I got injured on the first day.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.840
I just played through it.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.840
I still played every day.

14:01.840 --> 14:07.840
So what would happen was I would heal a little bit at night and then I would spend the day

14:07.840 --> 14:14.840
walking around the show floor, like hobbling around the show floor.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.840
You're like, I fake it pretty well on camera.

14:17.840 --> 14:23.840
So anything other than the gigabyte booth coverage and the, what was it?

14:23.840 --> 14:25.840
The core systems.

14:25.840 --> 14:32.840
I'm like, uh, uh, and so if you look at, if you look closely at the montage of me running

14:32.840 --> 14:38.840
when we did the video in the super micro booth where we had to like go on a fetch quest to

14:38.840 --> 14:41.840
get a replacement CPU and RAM for this blade server.

14:41.840 --> 14:45.840
If you look closely, I am like heavily limping in that video.

14:45.840 --> 14:50.840
So I would hobble around the show floor and then I would go play badminton, injure myself

14:50.840 --> 14:56.840
to barely being able to lift my leg out of an Uber to get out of it.

14:56.840 --> 15:01.840
And then I would do Brinson repeat the entire trip here.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.840
I've actually had a lot of fun.

15:03.840 --> 15:04.840
It's been really great.

15:04.840 --> 15:09.840
It's been so long since I've been in the thick of things.

15:09.840 --> 15:10.840
And you know what?

15:10.840 --> 15:16.840
It's funny because I've been seeing a lot of comments from people that are like, yeah,

15:16.840 --> 15:17.840
Linus seems better.

15:17.840 --> 15:22.840
He seems like he's having fun or he seems like he's, he's chilled out or he seems like whatever,

15:22.840 --> 15:26.840
you know, if the content's going to be like this when the new CEO comes in, I'm here for it.

15:26.840 --> 15:31.840
And at first I was like, that seems stupid.

15:31.840 --> 15:38.840
No offense because, you know, one of the videos that had a lot of comments like that was actually

15:38.840 --> 15:43.840
the $100,000 Minecraft PC build for Carl Jacobs.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.840
We shot that video like three months ago.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.840
Yeah.

15:47.840 --> 15:48.840
Yeah.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.840
I saw a bunch of videos about that on our cleaning video as well.

15:51.840 --> 15:52.840
I was like, hmm.

15:52.840 --> 15:53.840
Comments about that.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.840
But yes.

15:54.840 --> 15:55.840
Yeah.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.840
He said he saw a lot of videos about it.

15:57.840 --> 15:58.840
Yeah.

15:58.840 --> 15:59.840
He's tired too.

15:59.840 --> 16:04.840
We both went out for a beef noodle soup at like 2.30 in the morning last night because

16:04.840 --> 16:05.840
that's a smart thing to do.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.840
Who's worth it?

16:06.840 --> 16:07.840
It is good soup.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.840
It was really good soup.

16:08.840 --> 16:09.840
Yeah.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.840
Okay.

16:10.840 --> 16:14.840
At first I was thinking to myself, okay, these guys are just looking for something.

16:14.840 --> 16:21.840
But I gotta say, I felt creatively liberated at the show this year.

16:21.840 --> 16:22.840
Cool.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.840
I didn't feel like I had to just do traditional booth coverage.

16:25.840 --> 16:30.840
And honestly, I didn't want to because I could have uploaded the same thing we would have

16:30.840 --> 16:32.840
uploaded at Computex four years ago.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.840
But I feel like the channels come a long way since then.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.840
I feel like the community expectations have come a long way since then.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.840
And I feel like the industry has changed a lot since then.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.840
I will talk about the pool thing.

16:44.840 --> 16:51.840
I know that's our headline topic, but I actually want to talk about this other topic first.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.840
And this was almost going to be a rain walk video.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.840
I might still write it up and shoot it before we leave.

16:57.840 --> 17:02.840
But I want to talk through some of the thoughts that I had just here on the WAN show because

17:02.840 --> 17:05.840
you guys probably noticed, right?

17:05.840 --> 17:14.840
We shot almost nothing this year in terms of PC gaming, like for the LTT channel.

17:14.840 --> 17:20.840
I mean, Noctua has that really cool offset mounting bar thing.

17:20.840 --> 17:25.840
So you can drop your temperatures a little bit on AM5 CPUs by actually moving the cooler

17:25.840 --> 17:29.840
down to where the CCDs are under the IHS.

17:29.840 --> 17:38.840
And other than that, our first video was Nvidia's Grace Super Chip and Grace Hopper data center.

17:38.840 --> 17:50.840
Our second video is for systems cooling, which, okay, if this matures the way that they think they can.

17:50.840 --> 17:56.840
Wow, it's going to be an absolute game changer for gaming laptops.

17:56.840 --> 18:02.840
But if the view rates on laptop videos or anything to go by from you guys,

18:02.840 --> 18:05.840
I'm thinking you mostly care about desktops.

18:05.840 --> 18:13.840
And I just, I don't see this technology making its way into the desktop in any realistic amount of time.

18:13.840 --> 18:18.840
Like just from a cost perspective, it won't make sense because you don't need the benefits.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.840
You don't need the size benefit.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.840
So why are you paying for it, right?

18:23.840 --> 18:24.840
The Noctua cooler.

18:24.840 --> 18:25.840
Oh, right.

18:25.840 --> 18:26.840
Then Super Micro.

18:26.840 --> 18:30.840
Super Micro was one of the other really interesting things at the show.

18:30.840 --> 18:31.840
These micro blade servers.

18:31.840 --> 18:32.840
Did you watch this video?

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
No.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.840
Okay.

18:34.840 --> 18:41.840
These are super cool because instead of using server CPUs, they're just risings.

18:41.840 --> 18:48.840
And so instead of going multi socket, they're just blades with full rise in PCs.

18:48.840 --> 18:52.840
So it's a 3U rack with eight full computers in it.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.840
And you can put up to rise in 7950X3Ds.

18:55.840 --> 19:04.840
So if you wanted to do like a high performance game server, like top tier single threaded performance, this is it.

19:04.840 --> 19:10.840
And you can still, you know, slice them up and virtualize them because, you know, it just occurred to me.

19:10.840 --> 19:19.840
I don't think we're grateful enough that virtualization for, this would be a really interesting thing to dig into in a tech quickie or something like that.

19:19.840 --> 19:24.840
How did we end up with proper virtualization support on the desktop?

19:24.840 --> 19:28.840
It is kind of surprised that hasn't been a gated feature at some point.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.840
Well, I think it was at some point.

19:30.840 --> 19:37.840
I think in the early days, it was like, I'm trying to think like SRIOV.

19:37.840 --> 19:45.840
I don't think was something that even if it was supported by the CPUs, I think motherboard manufacturers weren't implementing it into the, into their biases.

19:45.840 --> 19:49.840
I know ILMMU is something that has matured a lot over the last 10 years.

19:49.840 --> 19:54.840
Okay, so it's been a minute, but yeah, like Intel Core 2 Duo apparently had some issues.

19:54.840 --> 19:55.840
Okay, yeah.

19:55.840 --> 19:56.840
Virtualization being locked off.

19:56.840 --> 19:57.840
Yeah, so there you go.

19:57.840 --> 20:05.840
The fact that we ended up with that is kind of a miracle when you look at the way that it didn't happen with GPUs.

20:05.840 --> 20:10.840
And to be clear, there has been stuff at the show this year that is gamer focused.

20:10.840 --> 20:19.840
I mean, we've got a short that I shot for short circuit on ASUS's concept GPU that moves the 12 volt power off of the top.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.840
So there's no cable and it's just got a finger on the bottom.

20:22.840 --> 20:29.840
But I feel like a lot of noise was made about how innovative that was from people who don't cover Mac.

20:29.840 --> 20:38.840
Because when Apple launched the latest cheese grater Mac Pro, that's exactly how they did the power for the GPUs in it.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.840
And it supported cables.

20:40.840 --> 20:49.840
So it had female connectors on the motherboard and you could buy a cable kit so you could plug like a non first party GPU into it.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.840
You could power it that way.

20:51.840 --> 20:56.840
But it just had an extended slot at the back and you plugged it in like that.

20:56.840 --> 20:57.840
And that was how it was powered.

20:57.840 --> 21:02.840
And I'm sitting here going like, I mean, is that really gaming news then?

21:02.840 --> 21:07.840
A couple brands showed off even bigger 4090s.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.840
Sweet. That's what we need.

21:10.840 --> 21:11.840
Nice.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.840
So Cooler Master did.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.840
And then this wasn't in our Computex roundup here.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.840
It's not in our notes, but ASUS also did when I popped by.

21:20.840 --> 21:31.840
They have a mock up of a Noctua edition cooler that has 140 millimeter fans on it.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.840
Noctua's new 140 millimeter fans.

21:34.840 --> 21:41.840
So it probably performs like a hot damn, but it is absolutely colossal.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.840
We're going to have a tweet going up with just like your classic.

21:44.840 --> 21:52.840
I'm holding a regular size GPU and I'm holding that when you versus the guy she tells you not to worry about, you know, that sort of thing.

21:52.840 --> 22:03.840
But really the big news, the big innovations were in the data center were in, you know, mobile.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.840
Intel showed nothing for a consumer desktop.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.840
Yeah.

22:08.840 --> 22:11.840
AMD showed nothing for consumer desktop.

22:11.840 --> 22:16.840
Nvidia showed nothing for consumer desktop.

22:16.840 --> 22:21.840
When was the last time that that happened at Computex?

22:21.840 --> 22:26.840
Yeah, that's rough and not even consumer desktop.

22:26.840 --> 22:30.840
I mean, we're not even seeing we're not even seeing up.

22:30.840 --> 22:31.840
There's hints.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.840
There's hints that there's a new thread ripper coming.

22:34.840 --> 22:51.840
But is it going to be a thread ripper for enthusiasts or is it going to be thread ripper pro, which is priced for professionals and is not really going to be applicable to gamers at all anyway because the motherboards are going to cost $1,300 like we've seen with the current thread ripper pros.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.840
Yeah.

22:54.840 --> 22:59.840
The curious bread says I'm so sick of Nvidia this and video that I want to see the competition rise up.

22:59.840 --> 23:06.840
You got to give you got to give credit to Nvidia though they they just keep kind of they keep kind of killing it.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.840
I guess I'll also throw a shout out to Intel.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.840
They're trying.

23:10.840 --> 23:11.840
Yeah.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.840
Yeah, they're trying on it.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.840
Most price cuts recently are actually like really compelling.

23:16.840 --> 23:17.840
Yeah.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.840
199 for an a 750.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.840
Like that's actually correct.

23:22.840 --> 23:27.840
It only has eight gigs of VRAM guys but like it's $200.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.840
Yeah.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.840
Like that's freaking awesome.

23:30.840 --> 23:36.840
It's actually why competitions back, but it seems to be between Intel and AMD.

23:36.840 --> 23:37.840
Yeah.

23:37.840 --> 23:38.840
At the low end.

23:38.840 --> 23:39.840
Yeah.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.840
Because I mean Nvidia comes in with the 4060.

23:41.840 --> 23:44.840
Okay, we're going to talk about Nvidia in more detail later.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.840
Yeah.

23:45.840 --> 23:46.840
Yeah.

23:46.840 --> 23:59.840
That's, you know, first I want to, I want to talk about, you know, this, this, this kind of this topic that I wanted to discuss, which is like PC gaming is kind of in trouble.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.840
Yeah.

24:01.840 --> 24:06.840
Is it PC gaming or is it PC gaming hardware enthusiasts?

24:06.840 --> 24:10.840
I think it's a little bit of, I think it's a little bit of both, right?

24:10.840 --> 24:24.840
Because there's a lot of excitement for, you know, higher fidelity graphics, for example, and for, you know, game design that pushes the envelope.

24:24.840 --> 24:35.840
And, you know, whether that's in game physics, or whether it's, you know, much larger scale multiplayer, or whether it's like there's lots of different things that are not just.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.840
More eye candy. Yeah.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.840
Faster GPU, right.

24:40.840 --> 24:49.840
And one of the observations that I made at the show is that a lot of the really exciting stuff that's happening right now is in the data center.

24:49.840 --> 24:59.840
And more worrying that data center tech is not the kind of thing that I am expecting to trickle down to gamers in a meaningful way.

24:59.840 --> 25:03.840
And so I want to kind of explain what I mean by that.

25:03.840 --> 25:11.840
In the past, we saw innovation, like there's always been this, I shouldn't say always been, but there has traditionally been this trickle down.

25:11.840 --> 25:22.840
So when multi core was a big push in the data center, you know, back, especially when software was licensed per socket, right?

25:22.840 --> 25:27.840
All of a sudden there was this push to have more and more cores per socket, right?

25:27.840 --> 25:33.840
And then when performance per watt was a big push in the data center, all of a sudden we saw

25:33.840 --> 25:39.840
efficiency gaming brands talking about how important efficiency was for your new gaming CPU.

25:39.840 --> 25:44.840
It's been great because power prices and a lot of places around the world are like through the absolute roof right now.

25:44.840 --> 25:48.840
But right now what we're talking about is accelerators.

25:48.840 --> 25:54.840
We're talking about, I mean, AMD launched that really cool looking video encoding accelerator.

25:55.840 --> 26:01.840
When talking about things like AI accelerators and whatnot though, I do think that's actually going to trickle down.

26:01.840 --> 26:09.840
Because we're talking about things like, okay, not in the gaming space, but there's that talk recently about the generative AI that's in Photoshop.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.840
That's actually pretty big.

26:11.840 --> 26:20.840
And then I do believe there's going to be games that like, you know, procedurally generated game styles where it's procedurally generated through AI accelerated tasks.

26:20.840 --> 26:27.840
But tell me this, will that AI make its way to your local processing in a meaningful way?

26:27.840 --> 26:32.840
Or will that generative AI be done in a cloud server somewhere?

26:32.840 --> 26:35.840
I actually genuinely think it will be both.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.840
You think it will be both?

26:36.840 --> 26:46.840
Because I think there's going to be single player games that have procedural generation built into it and they can use your local processing to do it.

26:46.840 --> 26:53.840
How are the games rating organizations going to rate a game that has real time generated content in it?

26:53.840 --> 26:57.840
Especially with AI's ability to just like screw up.

26:57.840 --> 26:58.840
Yeah.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.840
And hallucinate, just do the wrong thing.

27:00.840 --> 27:05.840
Because you can put like bumpers, but it can also just go around it or find alternatives.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.840
So that's going to be interesting.

27:07.840 --> 27:18.840
All right. Well, you're getting ahead of me a little bit here, but I was going to point out that some of the things that we're seeing in the data center space right now are just plain, not beneficial to consumers.

27:18.840 --> 27:19.840
Yes.

27:19.840 --> 27:24.840
PCIe Gen 5. This is going to be kind of an unpopular take, I think.

27:24.840 --> 27:35.840
But I fully support that both NVIDIA and AMD and actually, I guess Intel for that matter, all delivered their latest gen GPUs with PCIe Gen 4.

27:36.840 --> 27:45.840
We clearly, obviously, do not need double the PCIe bandwidth for our gaming GPUs.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.840
And then, you know, storage.

27:47.840 --> 27:53.840
Storage is another area where brands are pushing PCIe Gen 5 really hard.

27:53.840 --> 28:04.840
But we've shown and other publications have shown time and time again that the benefit to PCIe Gen 5, to faster storage in general for gamers is basically nothing.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.840
Now, could that change?

28:06.840 --> 28:10.840
And then, right, the last point I was going to make is that it's all about accelerators now.

28:10.840 --> 28:23.840
So whether it's video encoding accelerators from AMD or whether it's AI accelerators or whether it's, you know, oh, like network accelerators.

28:23.840 --> 28:30.840
NVIDIA was really excited about this network accelerator they were showing off that has a 16 core CPU on it or something like that.

28:30.840 --> 28:41.840
There were comments on the video like NVIDIA's new network card has more compute cores on it than my entire household, you know.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.840
And it's really cool technology.

28:44.840 --> 28:49.840
But we look at how long gigabit was the standard for consumers.

28:49.840 --> 29:02.840
And I'm sitting here going is encrypting your network is offloading network traffic encryption really going to be something we're going to see on a desktop computer in the next 10 years, 15, 20.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.840
It's hard to look that far ahead.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.840
Yeah, but I kind of doubt it.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.840
And so I'm looking at all these innovations.

29:08.840 --> 29:16.840
So PCIe Gen 5, even in the data center, a big part of it is simplifying board layouts and making them more economical.

29:16.840 --> 29:24.840
So, you know, taking an SSD and giving it two lanes of Gen 5 instead of four lanes of Gen 4 and getting that same bandwidth.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.840
And I think we're going to continue to see that moving into into Gen 6.

29:27.840 --> 29:44.840
And so we may not even see consumer platforms adopt Gen 6 just over the over the power consumption limitations, or we might see it them use Gen 6, but just use fewer lanes for everything as opposed to actually making things faster.

29:44.840 --> 29:54.840
Yeah, where I wanted to kind of pivot the conversation is to talk about and speculate how we could see these technologies being beneficial to consumers.

29:54.840 --> 30:03.840
I mean, one area where faster storage is supposed to help, right, is direct storage.

30:03.840 --> 30:10.840
Yeah, but we've seen a couple of direct storage games, and it hasn't really made a difference.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.840
So what's what's the deal with that?

30:13.840 --> 30:16.840
Is it just that these games were not developed?

30:16.840 --> 30:21.840
Start to finish enough around fast storage hardware?

30:21.840 --> 30:24.840
Yeah, I think there's also the like early adopter thing.

30:24.840 --> 30:32.840
Like, you know, when a console first comes out, look at Tears of the Kingdom versus the first one, Breath of the Wild.

30:32.840 --> 30:43.840
There was pretty significant improvements that happened there, as far as my understanding goes, if you actually happened to play it on a switch instead of emulating it.

30:43.840 --> 30:53.840
But like, they're going to get better at using it over time, but there also needs to be incentives for these devs to have to like work harder to actually do that.

30:53.840 --> 31:04.840
And there's there's conversations going around recently about how like developing for the switch is where you're seeing pretty much all of the effort going into being efficient with things.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.840
You can see PC games coming out there like 140 gigs.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.840
Yeah, just like, oh, yeah.

31:10.840 --> 31:14.840
So they did. Yeah, I don't know. We'll see it happen.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.840
Okay, what else could we use faster storage for?

31:17.840 --> 31:29.840
I mean, that's always been something that's been kind of baffling to me, you know, when I'm, you know, performing some some simple operation, my CPU sitting at 4% usage, my Rams barely touched.

31:29.840 --> 31:41.840
And my supposedly, you know, seven gigabyte a second SSD is pinned at a at 100% and like, I'm not even doing, I'm not even doing that much.

31:41.840 --> 31:52.840
You know, it realistically is the limitation always just going to be the controllers and the NAND flash as opposed to the pipes to them but let's say, let's say they can build faster flash and and we reduce that bottleneck.

31:52.840 --> 32:06.840
You know, what would we do with faster storage so direct storage theoretically would allow us to do PS five type things where you're streaming game data directly off of the SSD, like streaming textures.

32:06.840 --> 32:13.840
See, I'd like to see an Xbox like resume, but not just from suspend from like hibernate.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.840
Is there any reason is well no think about it.

32:16.840 --> 32:21.840
No, I love the concept. I just windows and sleeping.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.840
But great concept though.

32:23.840 --> 32:27.840
Yeah, we're no we're we're having we're we're we're thinking optimistic.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know it's great.

32:30.840 --> 32:49.840
I do like that a lot. Being able to sleep your computer in the middle of heavy tasks like gaming or potentially whatever else and come back to it and have it actually resume in the middle of it would be would be cool.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.840
Fire simulations.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.840
Guys.

32:55.840 --> 32:59.840
I mean, I guess.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.840
Yeah, there's not. There's not.

33:01.840 --> 33:08.840
Oh, this is it store things faster. What a what a comment. Amazing.

33:08.840 --> 33:18.840
Oh, discussion question handyman over on float plane chat asks, have I buried the hatchet with Jensen from Nvidia.

33:18.840 --> 33:23.840
I actually do have an update on that so I can I can talk about that a little bit.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.840
But I'm worried.

33:26.840 --> 33:35.840
I think you're right. I think AI, AI games are are going to be they're going to have a moment.

33:35.840 --> 33:40.840
And then they're going to go away because they kind of sucked. Oh yeah, they're all going to be really bad.

33:40.840 --> 33:45.840
And then we're going to find ways to implement it into handcrafted games.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.840
And it's going to end up being I suspect the early ones.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.840
It's going to be like a selling feature of the game.

33:50.840 --> 33:51.840
Yes.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.840
It's going to be like CGI movies.

33:53.840 --> 33:54.840
Yeah, right.

33:54.840 --> 34:00.840
Where it starts out as doing CGI for the sake of doing CGI.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.840
Yeah.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.840
And then it turns into, you know, Wolf of Wall Street.

34:04.840 --> 34:11.840
Have you ever seen the side by side of Wolf of Wall Street shots before and after CGI watching the movie?

34:11.840 --> 34:13.840
You wouldn't even know.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.840
I wouldn't have thought there was any CGI heavy this film is.

34:16.840 --> 34:17.840
Wow.

34:17.840 --> 34:21.840
But there's like this, there's this helicopter shot of his beach house.

34:21.840 --> 34:26.840
And other than the house itself, like the surrounding area looks nothing like the original shot.

34:26.840 --> 34:29.840
They just, and there's this doorway that he walks through.

34:29.840 --> 34:33.840
And it's on a basically completely different building.

34:33.840 --> 34:37.840
And I'm just looking at it going, was that really necessary?

34:37.840 --> 34:41.840
But but it was integrated in such a way that I didn't notice it.

34:41.840 --> 34:42.840
I wouldn't have noticed at all.

34:42.840 --> 34:46.840
And so if that was the director's vision, then great.

34:46.840 --> 34:56.840
Yeah, like I suspect there's going to be some AI procedurally generated dungeon crawler, which exists purely because it is what I just said.

34:56.840 --> 35:04.840
Well, it's funny that you say that because the procedurally generated levels were a major selling point of Diablo one.

35:04.840 --> 35:05.840
Yeah.

35:06.840 --> 35:13.840
And so we might see better that, but it's going to be worse in certain ways.

35:13.840 --> 35:14.840
Oh yeah.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.840
Almost certainly it will be worse in certain ways.

35:16.840 --> 35:21.840
It's going to generate something that like the word for it is similar to something else.

35:21.840 --> 35:24.840
So it ends up spitting out the wrong thing and all this other problems are going to happen.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.840
But yeah, I think we're going to go too far at first and then it will fall back.

35:27.840 --> 35:34.840
And then when it starts to come back and properly, I think it'll be in ways that you don't necessarily notice a ton.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.840
But yeah.

35:37.840 --> 35:42.840
So honestly, with that timeline, I think we're like pretty significantly far out.

35:42.840 --> 35:51.840
And I guess that transitions us pretty perfectly to talking a little bit more in detail about Nvidia and what's been going on with them lately.

35:52.840 --> 35:57.840
Nvidia joins the $1 trillion valuation big boys club.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.840
Sorry gamers.

35:59.840 --> 36:08.840
And I alluded to this earlier right on the heels of their launch of the RTX 4060 where gamers were up in arms.

36:08.840 --> 36:24.840
Gaming media is up in arms over how, you know, awful the 4060 is from a competitive standpoint, how awful it is from a last gen to current gen upgrade standpoint.

36:24.840 --> 36:31.840
And then their stock jumps, you know, 25% the following day they briefly hit a $1 trillion valuation.

36:31.840 --> 36:42.840
This is alongside Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Saudi Aramco, which I don't know how to pronounce, but they go oil company.

36:44.840 --> 36:49.840
They're the first chip maker to touch the $1 trillion mark thanks to massive demand for AI processors.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.840
That is what it is all about.

36:52.840 --> 36:53.840
I think you nailed it.

36:53.840 --> 37:00.840
I think it was last WAN show when you were saying like I think they're not being price competitive on this GPU because it just didn't dedicate a lot of like manufacturing to it.

37:01.840 --> 37:02.840
I think that's it.

37:02.840 --> 37:10.840
I think why be price competitive when we don't even like we don't even have a ton of them because we want those lines to be dedicated towards other things.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.840
Here's the thing.

37:12.840 --> 37:16.840
I don't know if I was right anymore.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.840
I think it's a combination of things.

37:18.840 --> 37:27.840
They went to an aggressive new process node that is more expensive and does have lower yields compared to what AMD is able to do with their lower end cards.

37:27.840 --> 37:30.840
The 7600 was the most recent one.

37:30.840 --> 37:35.840
And I had a meeting with Nvidia at the show that I guess I should talk about, right?

37:35.840 --> 37:38.840
I don't know if any of it was on the record.

37:38.840 --> 37:47.840
So hopefully this is all kosher, but any who basically the here's what I think.

37:47.840 --> 37:50.840
And this is not anything that anyone at Nvidia said.

37:50.840 --> 38:00.840
This is just what I think from talking to some of the Nvidia folks from seeing what's going on with them on a business level.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.840
I think they should split up.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.840
I think they should spin off GeForce.

38:06.840 --> 38:07.840
Interesting.

38:07.840 --> 38:19.840
Because talking to the folks at Nvidia who do work on the GeForce team, looking at the kinds of unnecessary innovations that they are still bringing to gaming.

38:19.840 --> 38:25.840
So they announced a new ultra low motion blur technology that they've announced a few things.

38:25.840 --> 38:32.840
Yeah, yeah, that they claim gets to something I think is like 1600 Hertz motion clarity or something like that.

38:32.840 --> 38:41.840
It feels it feels very because we can make it a little bit better.

38:41.840 --> 38:56.840
You know, and, and that's especially true to me because we have display technologies coming down the pipe that are going to make that level of better image persistence on LCD totally unnecessary.

38:56.840 --> 38:57.840
Right.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.840
And so I'm looking at it going.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.840
Yeah.

39:00.840 --> 39:07.840
These guys in the lab are are are really trying to crush it here for gamers.

39:07.840 --> 39:26.840
And in some ways, I feel like they're kind of getting held back by the expectations that Nvidia, the organization's shareholders have for profitability, because GeForce is always going to be a consumer brand with consumer margins.

39:26.840 --> 39:27.840
Right.

39:27.840 --> 39:49.840
Whereas Nvidia's data center business, or their AI business for, for automotive, right, or their, you know, embedded products business, like all of these anything that's B2B is inherently going to have more margin, because your customer is making money on it.

39:49.840 --> 39:57.840
Like a new GPU is a burden, because all of a sudden there's all these new games that you couldn't play before that now it's time to buy and play.

39:57.840 --> 39:58.840
Yeah.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.840
I don't mean a burden personally.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.840
I mean a financial burden.

40:02.840 --> 40:03.840
Right.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.840
You're not outside of mining.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.840
You're not making money on it.

40:07.840 --> 40:25.840
But, but that's a really important point to make, because mining is such a great example of how when something makes you money, all of a sudden, even if you are an actual gamer, you're willing to pay so much more for it, because it helps offset the cost.

40:25.840 --> 40:26.840
Yeah.

40:26.840 --> 40:27.840
Right.

40:27.840 --> 40:45.840
The kinds of margins that Nvidia can make on something like a gray super chip are going to look really attractive to their shareholders, and the kinds of margins they can make on some RTX 4060, even if it seems completely unreasonable to you and to me, are going to look really unattractive.

40:45.840 --> 41:00.840
And as the proportion of this business shrinks on the gaming side and grows on the data center side, their shareholders are going to look at them and go, hey guys, what are you doing?

41:00.840 --> 41:01.840
Yeah.

41:01.840 --> 41:11.840
You should do even be making consumer GPUs anymore or shipping all the silicon, all the wafers you can get from TSMC or Intel for that matter.

41:11.840 --> 41:12.840
That's going to be interesting.

41:12.840 --> 41:16.840
Jensen said their next gen manufacturing node is looking good.

41:16.840 --> 41:21.840
Should you just be booking all of it for AI and completely ignoring gaming?

41:21.840 --> 41:23.840
And I don't think Nvidia wants to.

41:23.840 --> 41:30.840
That's what I wanted to say, is I think the GeForce team really wants to build great gaming experiences.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.840
And I feel like they're a little bit hamstrung right now.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.840
I have for quite a while now.

41:36.840 --> 41:38.840
I assume you've kind of felt the same thing.

41:38.840 --> 41:42.840
You know when you used to go to Nvidia.com and the main thing was drivers?

41:42.840 --> 41:45.840
GeForce drivers, specifically.

41:45.840 --> 41:56.840
Now, even if you go to GeForce.com, which just redirects to Nvidia.com slash GeForce, there's like the GeForce section, but then there's another banner above that.

41:56.840 --> 42:01.840
Just like making sure that you don't forget that there's a separation between GeForce and Nvidia.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.840
And you can go to the main menu of that.

42:04.840 --> 42:05.840
Nvidia.com.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.840
Which has nothing to do with GeForce.

42:07.840 --> 42:12.840
Even when you're on the specific GeForce page, just in case you didn't mean to be here, we've got you.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.840
Product solutions, industries.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.840
For you, whatever that means.

42:16.840 --> 42:22.840
I have always felt kind of weird about the Nvidia site for a while now, because of that reason.

42:22.840 --> 42:35.840
And this really ties into what I was talking about before, where it used to be that the innovations that Nvidia would build for their data center products would benefit gamers, would make their way down to gamers.

42:35.840 --> 42:42.840
But we've actually seen over actually, wow, I guess the last couple of generations.

42:42.840 --> 42:52.840
Volta was an example of an Nvidia chip that was built specifically not for gamers.

42:52.840 --> 42:58.840
And then Hopper, as far as I can tell, is simply not for gamers at all.

42:58.840 --> 43:08.840
It just doesn't have functional units you need for gaming, because it's laser focused on AI, right?

43:08.840 --> 43:24.840
And so we're not going to necessarily benefit from that R&D money that comes from enterprise customers and goes towards building a bigger, better GPU that ultimately gamers also get to kind of tag along with, right?

43:24.840 --> 43:39.840
And so, yeah, I don't know if I would like to see it, but I think it could make sense for Nvidia to just say, yeah, this is a spin off business, it's GeForce.

43:39.840 --> 43:55.840
They buy innovation from Nvidia. Essentially, they're a customer of Nvidia in the same way that a Nintendo would be a customer of Nvidia for the processor and the switch.

43:55.840 --> 44:04.840
And the GeForce team is laser focused on building great drivers, building great technologies to leverage the hardware from Nvidia.

44:04.840 --> 44:13.840
Obviously, they'd work very close together, but then they wouldn't have the burden of needing to make those same margins and they could get scrappier.

44:13.840 --> 44:27.840
And they could take the fight to AMD and, as Intel ramps up with Battle Mage and Celestial, their upcoming architectures, I think they could be more competitive because at the end of the day, right?

44:27.840 --> 44:35.840
Every fanboy has got to understand you don't want one to win.

44:35.840 --> 44:36.840
Yeah, yeah.

44:36.840 --> 44:51.840
Ever. That's not good. Whether we're talking the big three, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, every single one of them has shown again and again and again.

44:52.840 --> 45:07.840
In the absence of competition, the first thing they'll do is stop refreshing products and ramp up the price.

45:07.840 --> 45:12.840
Let's look for recent examples from each one. Shall we play a game?

45:12.840 --> 45:13.840
Sure.

45:13.840 --> 45:17.840
Do you want to go first or shall I go first?

45:17.840 --> 45:24.840
Intel pre-AMD's resurgence in the like, what would that have been, like five, six thousand series?

45:24.840 --> 45:27.840
Well, this number. This number is key.

45:27.840 --> 45:28.840
Four?

45:28.840 --> 45:29.840
Four.

45:29.840 --> 45:30.840
Okay.

45:30.840 --> 45:32.840
How many cores did you get?

45:32.840 --> 45:38.840
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Four cores forever was, that was a very long term.

45:38.840 --> 45:40.840
That ought to be all anyone needs, Lee.

45:40.840 --> 45:42.840
Yeah, that's good enough.

45:42.840 --> 45:52.840
Yeah. That's a perfect example. And then if we look to AMD, the second Intel didn't have an HEDT, a high end desktop competitor.

45:52.840 --> 46:10.840
AMD simply stopped bothering releasing new thread rippers, regardless of the commitments that they had already made, not just to their enthusiast and gamer customers, but to buyers of the STRX 40 or whatever it was called.

46:10.840 --> 46:15.840
Their last socket, their Ryzen 3000 thread ripper socket.

46:15.840 --> 46:25.840
They were just like, hey, it was basically done. There were samples out there. They just decided, yeah.

46:25.840 --> 46:26.840
Why bother?

46:26.840 --> 46:28.840
Threadripper pro is more profitable.

46:28.840 --> 46:29.840
And this is why bother.

46:29.840 --> 46:39.840
This is why for years as we've been rooting for AMD to push really hard, we've also been pointing out that they're not like, you know, the like magically benevolent good guys.

46:39.840 --> 46:47.840
There was that campaign that they ran a while ago where they had people with like protest signs at PAX and stuff. Do you remember that?

46:47.840 --> 46:48.840
No.

46:48.840 --> 46:49.840
Oh man.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.840
I don't think I saw that. It sounds cringe though.

46:52.840 --> 46:54.840
I don't remember the name of the campaign.

46:54.840 --> 46:57.840
Sounds cringe.

46:57.840 --> 47:03.840
It was like resist, like resist AMDs or resist Intel's whatever.

47:03.840 --> 47:08.840
I wonder if I can find it.

47:08.840 --> 47:15.840
I think it's probably been like too long and looking up anything that has to do with protest is just going to come up with a lot of news articles.

47:15.840 --> 47:17.840
So I think I don't think I'm going to find it.

47:17.840 --> 47:28.840
But yeah, at like PAX West back in the day, I remember there being like genuine paid actors with protest signs that had like, like resist blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

47:28.840 --> 47:32.840
And it was all AMD branding and it was all about like buy AMD to resist Intel.

47:32.840 --> 47:36.840
It's like, uh, yeah, you guys would do the same thing.

47:36.840 --> 47:37.840
Yup.

47:37.840 --> 47:42.840
I do want you to do better because competition is good, but yeah.

47:42.840 --> 47:43.840
Okay.

47:43.840 --> 47:46.840
So then the last one is NVIDIA.

47:46.840 --> 48:00.840
NVIDIA, I honestly feel like hasn't sat on their laurels as much in a technological sense as the other brands, but they have definitely taken advantage of what they can extract cost wise.

48:00.840 --> 48:01.840
Yeah.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.840
As much as possible.

48:02.840 --> 48:03.840
Yep.

48:03.840 --> 48:10.840
With them in some ways they're just kind of smarter about it because they're definitely doing it.

48:10.840 --> 48:19.840
And we talked about this when we did our tier list for the best GeForce GPUs, which by the way, I know I often ask you, have you watched the video?

48:19.840 --> 48:20.840
I know the answers.

48:20.840 --> 48:22.840
No, you should watch this one.

48:22.840 --> 48:25.840
I skipped through and watched the 8000 series because I like cared about that.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.840
You know how many people did that?

48:27.840 --> 48:29.840
It wasn't a lot.

48:29.840 --> 48:37.840
Well, not the 8000 series specifically, but the retention chart on that video is super weird.

48:37.840 --> 48:48.840
We actually had a debate internally before we started working on it for when we should start because we didn't start at the beginning.

48:48.840 --> 48:56.840
And we could have because there were only a few generations of GeForce GPUs before the starting point.

48:56.840 --> 48:59.840
And we didn't start later.

48:59.840 --> 49:08.840
So it was actually pitched to me that we start more like way, way more recently.

49:08.840 --> 49:09.840
I forget.

49:09.840 --> 49:14.840
I forget what the what the push was, but way more recently and and do do far fewer of them.

49:14.840 --> 49:23.840
And I picked FX and I forget why I think the rationale that I provided was it was right.

49:23.840 --> 49:26.840
The first DirectX 9 GPU.

49:26.840 --> 49:40.840
And I think this is just my own personal biases because for me, PC gaming really started to get, you know, visually really good looking with DirectX 9.

49:40.840 --> 49:45.840
And looking back at it, I think it was just my own personal.

49:45.840 --> 49:47.840
That's when I got into gaming.

49:47.840 --> 49:55.840
And so we see that in the retention graph for this video, how many people got into gaming with 900 series and 10 series.

49:55.840 --> 49:56.840
Yeah.

49:56.840 --> 50:01.840
Basically everything earlier is like, skip, skip, skip, skip.

50:01.840 --> 50:07.840
Oh, what about this one that I bought that I'm really passionate about or that's still in my gaming rig right now and I love this thing.

50:07.840 --> 50:09.840
I've been using it for years.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.840
Isn't that hilarious?

50:11.840 --> 50:14.840
Just how few people care.

50:14.840 --> 50:18.840
These spikes are so wow.

50:18.840 --> 50:19.840
Yeah, really extreme.

50:19.840 --> 50:21.840
I've never seen anything quite like this.

50:21.840 --> 50:22.840
That's very interesting.

50:22.840 --> 50:23.840
Yeah, it's really cool.

50:23.840 --> 50:26.840
Anywho, what was I talking about again?

50:26.840 --> 50:27.840
Right.

50:27.840 --> 50:29.840
So with NVIDIA, it's been more of a slow boil.

50:29.840 --> 50:43.840
And we talked about it a fair bit here where starting with the 600 series, this history is really important to understand when you look at NVIDIA's pricing strategy and you want to kind of get a better idea of where they're going in the future.

50:44.840 --> 50:57.840
So starting with 600 series and okay NVIDIA has code names for their GPUs and I hate that the word GPU has come to mean graphics card because they are not the same thing.

50:57.840 --> 51:02.840
A GPU is a graphics processing unit and it's a chip.

51:03.840 --> 51:12.840
A graphics card is a board that contains a GPU VRAM power delivery display outputs.

51:12.840 --> 51:13.840
Okay.

51:13.840 --> 51:30.840
So the GPUs, they have code names for these and typically they will have the a letter to indicate the architecture like GK would you be GeForce Kepler or GA would be GeForce Ampere.

51:30.840 --> 51:31.840
Okay.

51:31.840 --> 51:38.840
So they have a letter and then they have a number and that number, the final digit, the lower that digit is.

51:38.840 --> 51:44.840
So if it's a zero, that is going to be the largest chip for that series.

51:44.840 --> 51:48.840
If it's a two, that's going to be a smaller one.

51:48.840 --> 51:54.840
If it's a four smaller, six smaller, trying to remember how high they've gone in the past.

51:54.840 --> 51:58.840
But the point is the higher that number goes, the smaller the actual die is.

51:58.840 --> 52:06.840
So sometimes you'll see two GeForce GPUs that have, let's say one has 5000 CUDA cores and one has 4000.

52:06.840 --> 52:13.840
But if you dig into, you know, the tech power up GPU database or something like that, you'll find that they're both using the same chip.

52:13.840 --> 52:27.840
Well, some of those functional units might have been, some of those CUDA cores might have been damaged in manufacturing or they might have just been turned off to hit a lower power profile or to create segmentation between two products.

52:27.840 --> 52:30.840
So that, you know, this one doesn't perform too close to the other one.

52:30.840 --> 52:41.840
But other times you'll see that two products are using completely different dies because there's only so many CUDA cores on a die, even if it's perfect.

52:41.840 --> 52:52.840
And it only makes so much sense to cut them down before that's just a broken product and the power profile wouldn't make any sense for this, you know, more budget oriented product.

52:53.840 --> 52:56.840
So that's why you design these different sizes of dies.

52:56.840 --> 53:12.840
Finally getting there, with Kepler, that was the first time we saw Nvidia launch a flagship AD series GTX, you know, product, a top tier product with not the top tier die.

53:12.840 --> 53:21.840
Now we had seen before a top tier die, but with, no, it wasn't the first time.

53:21.840 --> 53:24.840
Okay, I'll talk a little bit about that other one later.

53:24.840 --> 53:31.840
We had seen not a top tier die, or we'd seen a top tier die, but not all of it.

53:31.840 --> 53:35.840
So a slightly cut down one and that would be due to yields, right?

53:35.840 --> 53:39.840
They just couldn't get enough fully working ones to make it economic-reviable.

53:39.840 --> 53:48.840
But we hadn't seen them launch a flagship GPU with a cut down with a not top tier die and then we didn't get big Kepler until 700 series.

53:48.840 --> 53:59.840
So we got Kepler and then we got Kepler again, something we, again, I don't think had actually seen in the past, but that's with an asterisk because the 9000 series was a little bit more complicated.

53:59.840 --> 54:04.840
Where 8000 series was awesome, G80, so that's 8-0.

54:04.840 --> 54:20.840
So that was a big die was the 8800 GTX and the 8800 Ultra was kind of usurped by G92, which was a shrunk and just like way more efficient, even though it was smaller die.

54:20.840 --> 54:26.840
So the 8800 GT came out and kind of made the GTX look pointless from a cost perspective.

54:26.840 --> 54:34.840
And then they tweaked that and released the 9800 GTX, which was not a big die, but there wasn't a big die version.

54:34.840 --> 54:45.840
It was just a really weird time for NVIDIA because they couldn't innovate as easily as they had been able to before that because they couldn't just keep shrinking the manufacturing process.

54:46.840 --> 54:54.840
That was kind of where we started to ask the question, is Moore's law dead? Is GPU innovation going to slow down in a big way?

54:54.840 --> 55:00.840
And it has. And that's the same thing where I'm talking about them boiling the frog in terms of slowing things down.

55:00.840 --> 55:10.840
There were definitely times when they could have probably pushed harder, but started stretching how long a GPU generation should stick around for.

55:10.840 --> 55:20.840
From, you know, I mean, they were launching new stuff like eight, 10 months after the previous generation sub one year windows for a bit there.

55:20.840 --> 55:27.840
And then it went to a year early cadence and then it went to, I mean, 18 months is fine, right? Two years, two years seems okay.

55:27.840 --> 55:31.840
By the way, I found it was called the AMD Uprising campaign.

55:31.840 --> 55:38.840
The whole thing was like joining the rebellion and hashtag better read and stuff.

55:38.840 --> 55:42.840
It was it was a weird campaign. I did not like it.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.840
It is what it is.

55:44.840 --> 55:48.840
Not the first odd marketing we've seen.

55:48.840 --> 55:51.840
And not the last moving on next topic.

55:51.840 --> 55:53.840
Oh, should we do three merge messages?

55:53.840 --> 55:56.840
We never did breakfast. There was one of these for you.

55:56.840 --> 55:58.840
Yeah, let's do a few merge messages.

55:58.840 --> 56:00.840
Dan, are you can you hear us?

56:00.840 --> 56:02.840
Oh, yeah, of course.

56:02.840 --> 56:04.840
Oh, it's Daniel Besser.

56:04.840 --> 56:07.840
Oh, wait, I'm supposed to explain merge messages.

56:07.840 --> 56:08.840
That's right.

56:08.840 --> 56:12.840
Merge messages. They're these things. They're how you interact with the show.

56:12.840 --> 56:18.840
We launched a new product on the store. Hey, Dan, do you have the capability of showing people the new product?

56:18.840 --> 56:20.840
Technically, yes.

56:20.840 --> 56:23.840
Oh, can we use AJ for this?

56:23.840 --> 56:26.840
Oh, this is going to be embarrassing.

56:26.840 --> 56:32.840
I mean, I guess we could show it on the website. Yeah, this might take a minute though.

56:33.840 --> 56:38.840
I have a couple on the table. We could just show them with a camera.

56:38.840 --> 56:43.840
You know what? I'm going to propose something even jankier.

56:43.840 --> 56:48.840
Oh, I love it.

56:48.840 --> 56:51.840
It's the fleece lined jacket.

56:51.840 --> 56:54.840
It's a sweater. It's a jacket.

56:54.840 --> 56:58.840
It's launching in June because we just love our Australian community so much.

56:58.840 --> 57:04.840
Actually, it's because we only launch things when they're ready, and this is when it happens to be ready.

57:04.840 --> 57:06.840
Wait, no, it's a shirt or a jacket.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.840
Oh, shirt meets jacket. Excuse me. Yeah.

57:09.840 --> 57:12.840
I could show it with a producer cam.

57:12.840 --> 57:20.840
It's pretty cool. It's very warm, but it still looks just kind of like a shirt.

57:20.840 --> 57:26.840
It's nice for going out. I would say on a fall day, going for a walk in the park,

57:26.840 --> 57:32.840
you're not going to reach for anything else once you have one of these.

57:32.840 --> 57:36.840
It looks sharp. Yeah. Yeah, looks really sharp.

57:36.840 --> 57:40.840
We tried to make this reversible fun story. It did not work.

57:40.840 --> 57:41.840
Oh, yeah.

57:41.840 --> 57:52.840
Yeah, we thought it would be really cool if this kind of like camo stripy inner material was actually wearable on the outside,

57:52.840 --> 57:54.840
and it was not.

57:54.840 --> 57:59.840
Yeah, we do have a reversible garment coming soon, but it is not this day.

57:59.840 --> 58:06.840
Anywho, if you want to pick up one of these or anything else, you know, water bottle, screwdriver,

58:06.840 --> 58:15.840
stick locks have been really popular as well, then head over to lttstore.com and in the checkout,

58:15.840 --> 58:22.840
right in the cart, dang it, in the cart, a box will appear giving you the option to write a merge message.

58:22.840 --> 58:29.840
You can send a shout out for one of your friends or your mom who happens to watch the WAN show because she's Luke's mom.

58:29.840 --> 58:34.840
You can ask our producer a question.

58:34.840 --> 58:41.840
You can also post a question in hopes that Dan will choose your question to be addressed later on WAN show after dark,

58:41.840 --> 58:46.840
which there may not be any after dark because it is the morning where we are.

58:47.840 --> 58:54.840
Anyway, the point is, don't do super chats, you know, don't do twitch bits or whatever else do merge messages,

58:54.840 --> 59:02.840
because then even in the event that we don't get to your message, you get your order in the mail and it's going to be quality.

59:02.840 --> 59:09.840
We do not talk nearly enough about how well reviewed our products are.

59:10.840 --> 59:17.840
Just about every product on lttstore, four and a half stars and up, and we don't curate this stuff,

59:17.840 --> 59:19.840
we believe in transparency.

59:19.840 --> 59:21.840
There's a lot of reviews.

59:21.840 --> 59:35.840
You go on the screwdriver page, it really is very funny to me when haters talk about what a failure the backpacker screwdriver were or whatever.

59:35.840 --> 59:38.840
Did you see 6,900 reviews on screwdriver?

59:38.840 --> 59:42.840
And, you know, backpack, no one would be stupid enough to buy this backpack.

59:42.840 --> 59:46.840
It has almost 2,500 reviews.

59:46.840 --> 59:48.840
They didn't come from nowhere.

59:48.840 --> 59:52.840
They're not generative AI reviews, guys.

59:52.840 --> 59:58.840
These are real reviews from real people that are thrilled with it because it's a freaking awesome backpack.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.840
All right, Dan, want to hit us with some merge messages?

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.840
Yeah, sure thing.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.840
Let's see, first one here.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.840
Hey, LLD, would you ever want to fly to space?

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.840
How, for how long and where would you like to go?

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.840
The International Space Station, the moon, maybe Mars?

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.840
What? What was the question?

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.840
Do you want to go to space?

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.840
Yeah, definitely.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.840
Is it wondering where in space you want to go?

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.840
Okay.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:29.840
Would you ever want to fly to space?

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.840
Yes, for sure.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:31.840
How long?

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.840
I don't know, ever.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.840
Where would you like to go?

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.840
Not forever.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.840
Yeah, why not?

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.840
Come on.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.840
You're not going to go to space forever.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840
I'd be down.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.840
No.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.840
Would you vacation to Earth?

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.840
I'd be sad.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.840
Give a better answer.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.840
I don't know.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.840
I would love to do a one-year stint.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.840
Obviously, this is never going to happen.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.840
A year?

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.840
Yeah, because then you get a special thing.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.840
I don't know what it's called.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.840
Maybe sweet.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.840
Destroyed bone density?

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.840
It's an achievement.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.840
You get a one-year achievement.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.840
It's basically that.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.840
I know.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.840
You get some special badge or something.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.840
I never thought about it that way.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840
Oh my.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.840
Oh my.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.840
There we go.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.840
My laugh is very obnoxious.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.840
It's called muscle atrophy.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.840
There's ways to stave that off.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.840
The scarier thing is your bones,

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.840
but you address both in the same way.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.840
You do it by working out.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.840
It's not going to happen a year.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.840
Well, yeah, but that's another question proper.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840
Okay.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840
Where would you go?

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.840
You just would want to orbit or what?

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.840
I think whatever gets you the most patches.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.840
Yeah, probably.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.840
I think, I think if, I mean, okay,

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.840
if we want to think about that way,

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840
if you could be the first,

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.840
if you could be the first to step foot on Mars,

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.840
that'd be sick.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.840
That'd be sweet.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.840
But if we're assuming that isn't so much of a thing.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.840
Yeah.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.840
I don't think I'd want to do the whole Mars thing.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.840
It's really far.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.840
I think I'd be far more likely to go to a moon base

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.840
and then come back because it's like more time.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.840
Yeah.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.840
It is actually like wild how much closer it is.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840
Yeah.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.840
It's kind of wild how much closer the ISS is

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840
compared to the moon.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.840
I think a lot of people don't consider that as well.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.840
Yeah.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.840
A lot further.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.840
Not that close.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.840
Yeah.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.840
Genuinely not.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.840
I think some, I think like an actual lunar base would be pretty

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.840
sweet because honestly,

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.840
I don't see the difference between the ISS and a lunar base being

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.840
all that much in terms of cost or in terms of,

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.840
no, like the experience.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.840
Really?

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.840
Sorry.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.840
Sorry.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.840
You're high.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.840
No, no, no, no.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.840
Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:48.840
I don't see that.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:49.840
I don't see that.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.840
Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:51.840
I said it wrong.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.840
I don't see that building back there.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.840
You're higher than that building.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.840
And I see another orbiting station being much higher than being on a

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.840
station that is on the surface.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.840
And then I see probably being able to exit the station and go

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.840
wander around the moon,

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.840
being much more likely than spacewalks,

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.840
because spacewalks are like super, super coveted.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:12.840
Right.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.840
And even a bunch of astronauts that don't go up are never allowed to do

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.840
spacewalks.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840
Yeah.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.840
So like, I think it's much more likely if you're actually on.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.840
I would 100% want to just like,

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.840
I mean, not golf because you'd never find the ball,

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.840
but like I would, I would want a sports ball on the moon.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.840
Putting a little tracker in a golf ball and then just whacking it

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.840
would actually be pretty cool.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.840
You'd never like, I'd want to get it back though.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.840
Like I'd want to see it go and you would like it would just,

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.840
I assume anyway.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.840
I don't know.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.840
I've never been to it.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.840
It would depend how hard you hit it because I mean the moon has

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.840
got like it's going to theoretically,

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.840
unless you can get like escape velocity from the moon.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.840
Yeah.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.840
No, I'd want to like, no, I just, I just,

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.840
would it go around the horizon potentially?

01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.840
Like, I don't know.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.840
I mean, you wouldn't be able to see it anymore.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.840
Yeah, I definitely.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.840
Almost certainly.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.840
That's, that's the bigger concern I think.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.840
But like, no, I'd want to throw like a football.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.840
The ISS has no gravity that can affect experiments.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840
Yeah.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.840
But like, I'm a big dummy.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.840
I don't think I'm doing experiments.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.840
Yeah.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.840
No, I mean, yeah.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.840
No, I would just, I would want to help.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.840
I would want to play sports ball.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.840
Like I would just, I'd want to see how fast I could whip a baseball

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.840
in like almost no atmosphere.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.840
Yeah.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.840
Because there's also no, no wind resistance essentially

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:29.840
compared to earth anyway.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.840
Jake mentioned playing diamond on the moon.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:32.840
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.840
Right.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.840
That would be pretty sick.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.840
Yeah.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.840
That would actually be very fun.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.840
Or not fun.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.840
Yeah.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.840
It might be not fun at all.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.840
Because it would be really slow.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.840
No, it would be fast.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:51.840
What slows down the shuttle is air resistance.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.840
Like it.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.840
Okay.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.840
So there's only, there's only certain shots where it falls down.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:58.840
Yeah.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.840
If you were, the smashes would be terrible.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.840
Yeah.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.840
If you had a smash, no one would be able to stop it.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.840
That's pretty great.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.840
That'd be freaking fun.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.840
Anyway.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.840
Okay.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.840
Sure thing.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.840
Hello, Luke and Linus.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.840
How do you think AI will affect gaming in the near future?

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:19.840
Do you think it will be, do you think it will make them lazy and slap it everywhere

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.840
instead of polishing the games or will it be more conservatively used?

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.840
I think I curated this for a specific reason.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:31.840
And it was the word lazy.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:37.840
Because AI is not lazy.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.840
What it is, is a tool.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.840
And I think that we're going to see very lazy implementations of AI.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:50.840
And Luke and I talked about this actually a little bit earlier on the show where,

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:56.840
yeah, I think developers are going to look at this AI buzz and go, okay,

01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:01.840
how can we cram AI into our game now so that we can put it on the box and

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:06.840
hopefully sell a few more units to nerds who want to try out AI conversations

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:07.840
with their waifus or whatever.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.840
I think that's going to be a genre that's going to lean heavily into AI,

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:16.840
be an innovator in the space, better or worse.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.840
But in much the same way that we could look at,

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:30.840
man, what would be a comparable feature?

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.840
I can't come up with anything right now because my brain is bad.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.840
But AI is a tool.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.840
So the fact that someone uses a hammer,

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.840
that doesn't make them lazy.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.840
Like the fact that they use a hammer instead of putting the nails in

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:49.840
by pushing them with their thumbs, that's not laziness.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.840
So as long as they're still working hard,

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.840
there's nothing inherently lazy about using a better tool.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:03.840
Now their AI has some ethical questions around it that need to be answered.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:07.840
And some genuine, like something that could be interpreted as lazy.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.840
Because you've talked about this too, right?

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.840
If you were going to play a single-player game,

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.840
you wouldn't want all the dialogue to be written by AI.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.840
Yeah.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.840
Because you'd want it to be more focused and efficient almost.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.840
Not 100%, but every word should have a reason for being there,

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.840
those types of things.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.840
So I don't know.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.840
I think you're going to see a huge range of this,

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.840
which shouldn't be too surprising if you've experienced much of the gaming industry.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.840
I'm sure we'll see some battlefield game or something

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.840
that just has absolutely atrocious dialogue,

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.840
because it's all just AI generated or something.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.840
And we are going to see maybe not laziness.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.840
This is the other reason I really didn't like this word,

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:50.840
because lazy seems to apply it to the actual devs themselves.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:57.840
Whereas I think it's more likely to be a cost-cutting measure from management.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.840
So what was a shoot?

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.840
I've forgotten.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.840
But there was some game where the box art was apparently almost certainly

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.840
procedurally generated.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.840
Did you see this?

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.840
There has also been games where their box art was just stolen from people.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.840
In this case, it looked like it was procedurally generated,

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.840
because the guy had six fingers,

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.840
and there were little details,

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.840
and some artists broke down what's going on here,

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.840
what makes it obvious, Duke Nukem.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.840
The Duke Nukem remaster, yeah.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.840
Pull it up, have a look.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.840
Sorry guys, we don't have a good way of screen sharing right now,

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.840
so please pull this up for yourself.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.840
Yeah, here we go.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:48.840
Duke Nukem remaster AI box art is what Luke typed in.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:56.840
And apparently the artist who was involved has used generative AI

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.840
for artwork in the past as well.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.840
So in this case, was it laziness?

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.840
Was it an extremely tight budget?

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.840
Did they give the go-ahead to use AI?

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.840
I haven't looked into this any further yet,

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:15.840
so take this for the ignorant speculation that it is.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.840
But I don't think it's fair to assume that it's just laziness,

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.840
but I also don't think it's impossible.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.840
Yeah, this is pretty jank.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.840
I don't see why people are kind of annoyed about this.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.840
Yeah.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.840
Yeah.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.840
That's just like a hand like floating under the firearm.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.840
It's not even like in anything.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.840
That's like not, that's not a barrel.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.840
It just actually isn't.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.840
I don't know, that's weird.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.840
Yeah.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.840
Anyways, next up.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:56.840
I guess this will be our last one for this section.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840
Hi, LLD.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.840
I'm 16 and do more robotics techie videos on YouTube.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.840
In the early days of LTT, how did you stay motivated

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:11.840
and how long in the future would you say YouTube would still be a feasible career?

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.840
Hmm.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.840
Needing to eat is a pretty good motivator.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.840
I think we're also all pretty determined to like make this thing work.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.840
I was, I mean, I've talked about this in the past before,

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.840
but one of the major motivators for me was just that I was tired of working

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:33.840
with people that I didn't enjoy working with,

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.840
whether it was reporting to people who I didn't think deserved their positions,

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.840
who I didn't think were very smart,

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:47.840
or whether it was having to collaborate with people who were obvious nepotism hires

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.840
and had no valuable skills to bring to the table whatsoever.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.840
I wanted a company that was not built like that,

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.840
and the only way to get that is to start my own.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.840
The only way to get it and be sure it won't go away is to start my own.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.840
And so I just really needed this thing to work.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.840
Yvonne and I also just generally bet really heavily on it.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:16.840
So, you know, especially once we acquired the Langley house,

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.840
it's funny to look back at it now,

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:25.840
but we thought we were buying at the peak at like the highest conceivable,

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:30.840
you know, housing pricing ends up, we got a stellar deal or whatever,

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.840
but we didn't know that at the time.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.840
So we thought we were basically putting everything we had into this company

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.840
and we just really needed it to succeed.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.840
And there were multiple phases where we kind of did the same thing again.

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:49.840
When we bought the office, we thought the same thing that we were buying at the peak

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.840
and it couldn't possibly go any higher.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.840
So we thought we were completely betting the farm and we needed this to succeed,

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:01.840
or like going back to our jobs, there was no possible way we were paying this office mortgage.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.840
That wasn't happening, right?

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.840
So, yeah, eating, major motivating factor.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.840
As for how long in the future did I think YouTube would still be a feasible career?

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:19.840
I'll tell you this, we started LinusTechTips.com, the forum,

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.840
before we actually launched Linus Media Group the company,

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.840
and LinusTechTips.com, maybe not main reason,

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:33.840
but at least half of its main reason for existing is in case YouTube just decides,

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.840
you know what, forget about this channel anymore.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.840
We didn't have a contact at YouTube at that time.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:43.840
We didn't know that they would continue to take the creator community seriously.

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.840
We didn't know if they would just, you know, cut your AdSense payment,

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.840
or maybe you get three strikes out of nowhere,

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.840
or take it away entirely.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.840
We didn't know what the plan was for the platform, right?

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.840
We're just guessing.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:03.840
So at the time, no, I would take every deal.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:07.840
I would make every video thinking this could be the last one.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:14.840
And I don't think that really changed until three, four, five years in, really.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.840
I mean, even now, it still feels sketchy

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.840
because of like just dealing with algorithmic throws all the time.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.840
I don't know.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.840
It's a very unsettling industry to work in.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.840
It just is.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.840
Yeah, that's a good point.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:40.840
Luke was telling me he had some meetings with some creators that were,

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.840
I don't know if bewildered is the right word,

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:50.840
but just taken aback when he talked about how stressed we get about algorithmic changes

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:57.840
or about, you know, whether just the fear we have for our survival.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.840
And they're like, well, I thought you're past that point.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.840
And I was like, everybody, anybody ever gets past that point.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:12.840
That's the thing about like exponential decay, right?

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:17.840
Is no matter how high you start, everyone ends up at zero.

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.840
There's a near infinite graveyard of extremely massive,

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:26.840
extremely successful, very talented creators and channels and all that kind of stuff

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:32.840
that were household names on YouTube that are effectively just gone,

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.840
that are in a lot of cases still making content.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.840
You won't see them in your recommendation.

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.840
It feels like it can really happen to anyone.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:43.840
Really?

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:49.840
I've seen channels with with millions of subscribers that get hundreds of views.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.840
It's like, oh man.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:57.840
But in some cases, in some cases they change the content and it's just not working anymore.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.840
In some cases they didn't change the content and that's contributing to it not working anymore.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.840
And in other cases, I'm looking at it going, I can't really tell the difference.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:17.840
You know, the point is not to name and shame, but this person in particular did like a series.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.840
Wait, is this the right one?

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.840
I think I know what one you're talking about.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.840
Oh, here we go.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:27.840
Here we go.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.840
This one.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:29.840
This one.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:30.840
Yeah.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:43.840
Let me just make sure, because I don't want to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.840
I don't know.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.840
But basically,

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:46.840
I might not name it.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:54.840
Yeah, there was a creator that was doing real amazing and then just kind of completely fell

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:55.840
off the map.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:02.840
I'm talking like her top video has over 50 million views 11 years ago.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:09.840
And there's multiple videos here with 10 million views and more doing challenges and stuff.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:15.840
And then just, you know, she's talked about this, I think, if I'm remembering correctly,

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:24.840
she's talked about how it felt like she just disappeared overnight algorithmically.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:30.840
And again, this is a channel with millions of subscribers.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.840
Nobody, nobody is, nobody is safe.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.840
Yeah.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.840
Let me just see.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.840
Yeah.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.840
Oh, okay.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.840
Yes.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:50.840
Well, so she did an interview talking about how she went broke shared some advice for young

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.840
creators.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.840
And yeah, being, yeah, this is, this is great being broke with millions of subscribers.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.840
She shares her story of hardship.

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:00.840
Yeah.

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:01.840
Yeah.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.840
It's, it's a really, it's a really interesting fall, right?

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.840
Because it's not the type of content that I consume.

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:17.840
So I'm not really qualified to evaluate whether, you know, she changed or, or didn't change

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:24.840
or what, what the problem was that caused this precipitous decline in viewership.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.840
But no one's, no one's safe.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.840
That's, that's the whole point.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.840
So we're, we just need to, we need to keep reinventing.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.840
We need to keep pushing and we can never take our foot off the gas because if we do, we die.

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:41.840
It's, I, I often use shark analogies internally.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.840
Stop swimming.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:43.840
Die.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:44.840
Yeah.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:45.840
Yeah.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.840
Like actually though.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.840
Okay.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.840
So I think we go back to news.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.840
Sure.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.840
Why not?

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.840
Couple additional topics.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.840
All right.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:06.840
Secret gigabyte backdoor security researchers at eclipsium release findings showing millions

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:13.840
of gigabyte motherboards were sold with a UEFI boot kit containing an insecure backdoor.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:18.840
Eclipsium says the hidden code is meant to be an innocuous tool to keep the motherboards

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:23.840
firmware updated, but it's been implemented insecurely, potentially allowing the mechanism

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.840
to be hijacked on windows machines.

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:34.840
The program writes a windows.exe embed into the firmware to, in the firmware to disk in

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.840
the system 32 folder and runs it.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.840
The exe sets itself up as a windows service and attempts to fetch and an executable from

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:43.840
one of the URLs.

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.840
That is the, that is brutal.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:51.840
One URL uses HTTP, which is easily for an attacker to intercept and other links which

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:57.840
do use HTTPS are similarly vulnerable due to poorly implemented remote server certificate

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.840
validation.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:18:59.840
Okay.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.840
So let's, let's, let's do a real quick summary here in the firmware.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.840
Yeah.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:09.840
On this motherboard, they have, they have a tool that allows them to update and keep updated

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:13.840
the UEFI files, which sounds cool, which is really cool.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.840
Yes.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:21.840
The firmware actually can just write an exe to the system 32 folder.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.840
Which disguises windows service.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:31.840
I want to know how Microsoft allows random exes to be written to the system 32 folder

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:32.840
to be clear.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.840
I'm not saying gigabyte is innocent here.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.840
Yeah.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:42.840
I'm just, I'm, I'm saying that this is clearly a breakdown that has multiple contributing

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.840
actors here.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.840
Yeah.

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.840
Oh, wow.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:47.840
Okay.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.840
So one note, which is probably understood by most, but because this program is within

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.840
the firmware, it is difficult for consumers to remove.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:55.840
Okay.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:02.840
But the next note, at least 271 different models of motherboard are affected, including the

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.840
most recent Z790 and X670 skews.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.840
Holy crap.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.840
There is no current evidence of the vulnerability being exploited.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.840
This is a pretty niche thing.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:20.840
I wouldn't be surprised if most places were unaware that it existed a day after the story

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:25.840
broke, gigabyte has apparently rolled out updated firmware to mitigate the issue, including

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.840
updates for older motherboards that are affected.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.840
The problem is that there's going to be literally tons of people that don't update because people

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:38.840
very, very rarely millions, if not hundreds of thousands of boards out there that will

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.840
never get these updates.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.840
And never even know this is a problem.

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:48.840
I mean, I have to, well, wait, could they use their, could they use their update or tool

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.840
to like force an update?

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.840
That's a good question.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.840
They might actually be able to kind of solve the problem.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.840
That's a, that's a really good, that's a really good question.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.840
Um, guys, that's not in our doc.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.840
Let us know.

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:09.840
In the meantime though, our discussion question here is how would you rate gigabytes handling

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.840
of the issue?

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:17.840
I mean, the issue has existed for years, but they probably didn't know they mitigated

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:18.840
it really quickly.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.840
What I'm assuming happened is Eclipse and found it told gigabyte allowed gigabyte to fix

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.840
it, but then still wanted to break the news.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.840
That makes sense.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:30.840
So they launched the fix and the news at the same time, but they did fix it, which is,

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.840
which is good.

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:33.840
Yeah.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.840
But they put in a back door, which is not bad.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:37.840
Yeah.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.840
But the back door was not for, you know, sending your data to the CCP.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.840
It was for helping keep your firmware up to date.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:45.840
Yeah.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:46.840
Which is.

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:47.840
Noble enough.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.840
Good.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:49.840
Yeah.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.840
But they didn't tell us, which is bad.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.840
Yeah.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:57.840
The good, the good part is that they fixed it.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.840
Stuff like this is going to happen.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:04.840
I don't want to be the, that guy that's just like excusing it, but.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.840
I think we also have to be somewhat realistic.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:14.840
I feel like a lot of the time coverage of problems with products forgets the human

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.840
element.

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.840
Did you kind of get what I mean by that?

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.840
Yeah.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840
Yeah.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.840
Like this seems like, I mean, it seems like a mistake.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.840
It's not good.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:27.840
I wouldn't be happy about it if I was a consumer of a gigabyte motherboard that this affected.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.840
But like, it's also fixed immediately.

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:38.840
So it's not like, it's not like gigabyte was like, yeah, that's 271 models of mother

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:39.840
board.

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.840
We don't feel like supporting some of these old mother boards.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:46.840
As far as I can tell, at least from the notes in here, they updated everything.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.840
And as long as you do your own due diligence or maybe this thing can auto update itself.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:51.840
Yeah.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.840
I mean, huh, that's a really good point because that's one of those things that

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.840
worked out this time, but wouldn't necessarily have.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.840
I mean, look at Spectre and Meltdown.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:06.840
Intel was basically just like, eh, it's been a long time.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.840
That stuff's legacy.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.840
Forget it.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:10.840
And that's not cool.

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.840
I get it.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.840
But that's not cool.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:24.840
And if this, if we hadn't found this for another five years, would they have gotten updated?

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:25.840
Probably not.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:26.840
Probably not.

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.840
Probably not.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:32.840
And so, yeah, good, you know, good guy gigabyte, you know, dealing with it, but also it's far

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:35.840
better to just not do that in the first place.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:36.840
Yeah, for sure.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.840
I just like, I don't know.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840
It's good.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.840
If a company exists for a long enough period of time, something like this is going to happen.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.840
Yeah.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:49.840
We've an infamous Alex says we forget the human element because we're treated so poorly.

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.840
Anti-consumer market.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.840
It's become Yoda's writing into the show here.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.840
And you know what?

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:01.840
Yeah, I, you know, I, I get it.

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:06.840
And I think that's, you know, I think that's pretty, I think that's pretty fair in a lot

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:14.840
of cases, but I also think that, you know what, maybe part of it is just that I, I get to,

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.840
I get to be face to face with the people who build these products sometimes.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:23.840
And knowing that they're trying really hard makes me more appreciative of the things that

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.840
do go well sometimes.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.840
And it's not in like a, it's, it's not in a like, oh, I'm, you know, compromised kind

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.840
of way.

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:35.840
Like it's, it's not about money changing hands.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:40.840
Like I remember getting a pretty different perspective on Intel when I went to the Optane

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:41.840
launch event.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.840
It was super data center focused, but some of the gaming folks who were involved, like

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.840
directly involved in bringing Skull Trail to market.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:54.840
That was their super cool dual socket enthusiast thing that was really expensive and kind of

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:55.840
dumb.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.840
It was awesome though.

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:57.840
Well, very cool.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:02.840
We're there and just talking about how hard they push internally for these cool skunk

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.840
works projects and stuff like that.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:09.840
And it just, they didn't, they didn't pay me any money or anything like that.

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.840
It just, you know, you meet people and you get a better understanding of what they're

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.840
about.

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:20.840
And you learn that even these soulless companies and the shareholders, I, I have not changed

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.840
how I feel about shareholders at all.

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.840
Yeah.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:32.840
Shareholders are, are, they're a necessary evil, I think is the nicest thing I can say

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:38.840
about shareholders for public companies in particular, where the only, the only outcome

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:43.840
they want, typically speaking is more money, right?

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:49.840
Um, so I haven't changed how I feel about them, but the actual workers, the actual people,

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.840
the engineers, the, the designers, the janitors, it doesn't matter.

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:58.840
The people who are working on bringing us these products, a lot of the time they're really

01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.840
passionate.

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.840
They actually love what they do.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:07.840
Another really surprising moment for me was when I went to Micron and that was a special

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.840
video.

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:09.840
And that was a sponsored video.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:14.840
So, you know, take this for whatever, whatever you can talk about what a shill I am or whatever,

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.840
but that's, it has nothing to do with it.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:24.840
Um, I was just blown away by how excited these people were to make better memory and to get

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.840
a chance to talk about it.

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:27.840
Yeah.

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:28.840
That's the other thing, guys.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:34.840
These are not professional actors who are pretending to be so happy to be working at

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.840
Micron so that I'll make a nice video about them.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:38.840
It's not, it's not like that.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:44.840
These were, these were like the people who actually work on this stuff and you can tell

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.840
when someone's passionate because you ask a question and they talk for 10 minutes.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.840
I was going to say they won't stop talking about it.

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:51.840
Yeah.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.840
Finally, someone has asked me this.

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:54.840
Yeah.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.840
Do you know how long I toiled on this particular problem?

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:06.840
And, you know, other than my direct manager, everyone else in my life, I'm bound by NDA.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:07.840
Right.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:14.840
Like I'm just so thrilled to be talking to somebody about this, you know, and it's, it's

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.840
so cool.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.840
Right.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:22.840
And like it was the same at the Intel design lab that I visited in, in Tel Aviv.

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:23.840
Right.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:32.840
Like it, these people were just, you know, in some cases, the products were honestly

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:35.840
not ones that I personally enjoyed.

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840
Sure.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840
Yeah.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.840
But they were really proud of how they, you know, set a target and, you know, in collaboration

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.840
with management and who is beholden to shareholders, but this team, you know, damn it, they couldn't

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:52.840
control that, but they set a target and dang it, they hit it, you know, time and time again.

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.840
And this, this isn't a fab team, so Intel's had a lot of challenges shrinking their process

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:59.840
nodes, but this was like a chip design team.

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:00.840
And they were just proud.

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.840
They were just proud of the work they were doing.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.840
I'm like, that's cool.

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.840
You know, that's really cool.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:08.840
And I want to, I want to support that.

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:14.840
And I've got to understand that there's a lot of people watching when we make a video.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.840
And some of them are the consumers and we need to talk to them about whether you should or

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.840
shouldn't actually buy this thing.

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.840
And some of them are the shareholders.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.840
And some of them are the people who actually designed these products.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.840
And, you know, I just, I want to show respect.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:37.840
And I think we've taken some criticism recently for how we, how we show both sides of a product.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.840
But I think that's really important.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.840
We should appreciate what's good.

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:47.840
I mean, do we, do we want to get so jaded and cynical that we, that we just can't appreciate

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:53.840
the good of the tech that we can't just take joy in how cool this stuff is anymore?

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.840
There's also, and I've talked to you about this, but this is actually something that is consumed a

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:04.840
surprisingly large amount of my thoughts lately, which is I've noticed this.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.840
I feel like it's surprisingly recent, but maybe I just haven't been super tuned in.

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:17.840
But I've noticed a trend where a lot of the audience is very intent on all of the reviewers,

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.840
whether written or, or video or whatever, all saying the same thing.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:25.840
They want everyone to say the exact same thing.

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:28.840
I think that's super bad and very dangerous.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:29.840
Interesting.

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:32.840
My reasoning for that going on right now.

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.840
I think there is definitely too much group thing going on right now.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:42.840
My reason for that is I think it's beneficial not only to the audience, but to all the reviewers as well,

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:48.840
regardless of what medium they have, to have reviewers taking different approaches,

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:54.840
trying different things, coming to slightly different conclusions, and then you as the audience,

01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:00.840
check out a bunch of different pieces of content and make up your own mind based on these different approaches.

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.840
That is how I think it should work.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.840
That is how I think it has worked for a really long time.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:10.840
So when you absorb some piece of content, whether you're reading it or watching it or listening to it or whatever,

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:14.840
and then go to a different one and see a slightly different take.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.840
And all of a sudden one of them has to be right.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:17.840
Yeah.

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:18.840
And one of them has to be wrong.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.840
Yeah.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:20.840
I don't think that's good.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:21.840
Right.

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.840
I think that's bad.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.840
So just want to throw that out there.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.840
I think that's actually extremely bad.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.840
And I think this is one of those situations.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:35.840
And I hazard to say this type of stuff, but you don't want that.

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:36.840
Yeah.

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.840
I think you're chasing the wrong thing.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:43.840
I think that if you get to the result of what this thing is,

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:47.840
it's going to be just bad for everybody because you're going to get crazy consolidation.

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.840
There will be less reviewers.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:52.840
There will be, and then that will result in less things being found.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.840
I mean, I think it's a pretty clear.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.840
I think I've always been consistent.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.840
More competition is more better.

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:00.840
Yes.

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:04.840
And we can't say that about hardware manufacturers.

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.840
And not say that ourselves.

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:12.840
And then go, oh, but, but, but, but, but we need to be the only reviewer that you listen to.

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:13.840
Yeah.

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:19.840
No one voice should ever, ever be the only one in your ear.

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.840
That's always bad every single time.

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.840
It will never work out well.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:31.840
And that's one of the reasons that we have tried to be so collaborative with the rest of the tech community.

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:35.840
I mean, I think recently we've talked about how obviously, you know,

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:39.840
we're trying to build our organization to build the best possible content.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.840
Yeah, we can.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.840
You have to.

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:46.840
And, you know, if, if people are finding it hard to deliver the same quality of content,

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:51.840
then like, sorry, you know, find a different angle, right?

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.840
Yeah.

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.840
And, you know, let's go.

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:59.840
But we've also tried to work hard to, you know, build a spirit of collaboration in the tech community as well.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:03.840
I mean, you name a tech creator and we probably collaborated with them at some point.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.840
Or if we haven't, we've probably invited them to LTX this year.

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:11.840
There's actually a lot of creators that I have never even met that are coming to LTX this year.

01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:12.840
And I'm super excited.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:15.840
And we want to bring people together.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.840
We want to, I want to see collabs.

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.840
I think it's going to be really exciting.

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:20.840
It's going to be really fun.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.840
And that's because we're putting our money where our mouth is.

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:28.840
We're literally spending six figures on creator travel in hotels for LTX.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:37.840
We're spending a freaking lot of money to put our money where our mouth is and show that we actually do care about this.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:48.840
You guys should have as many voices as possible when you're trying to evaluate what to spend your hard earned money on because nobody is going to see things exactly the way you do.

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:56.840
And if they do, you got to kind of look in the mirror and go, are these actually my thoughts?

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:59.840
Or are these just someone else's thoughts?

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:00.840
And I'm just parroting them.

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:03.840
Am I actually doing any critical thinking here?

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:04.840
That's something.

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:08.840
Never stop critically thinking for yourself.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:13.840
I realized I never kind of came back to have I buried the hatchet with NVIDIA.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:18.840
Someone asked, have I resolved things with Jensen?

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.840
I haven't talked to Jensen in many years.

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:26.840
I think the last time I talked to Jensen was just to introduce myself at an event or something like that.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:31.840
I've never really spoken with him at length or anything.

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:49.840
But I definitely had some issues with our previous NVIDIA rep who simply revealed to me, regardless of the apology that went out to hardware and boxed afterward, revealed to me through his actions that he didn't respect media,

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:59.840
didn't properly understand our role in keeping NVIDIA accountable, felt that we were simply part of NVIDIA's marketing apparatus.

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:08.840
And at that point, I just, you know, I never apologized for anything that I said.

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:16.840
I think maybe an apology was expected, but I wasn't going to apologize because at the end of the day, I didn't say anything that was wrong.

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:27.840
And, you know, it was my team, my group, my media community that was disrespected.

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:31.840
You know, I don't owe you an apology for calling you out for being disrespectful.

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.840
Like, that's actually not how that works.

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.840
And that particular rep is no longer with the company.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:40.840
So that they are retired now.

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:44.840
And I met my new rep.

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:47.840
So they started just a few weeks ago, I think.

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:57.840
So before you, before you jump in with conspiracy theories about how we're, you know, that's, oh, that's why our video was, you know, more balanced for the 4060 or whatever.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:01.840
No, that's just how we're going to make videos where we want to look at everything.

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:05.840
We want to look at it from, shine a light on it from every angle.

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:15.840
So this is my first time meeting them, but they basically came in and were like, hey, I want to, I want to have a fresh start here.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.840
And I kind of went, that's nice.

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.840
It was, it was a tough meeting.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.840
It wasn't, you know, all sunshine and rainbows.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:26.840
Yeah.

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:32.840
Oh, I mean, there's some, there's some, there's some wounds to deal with there.

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:40.840
Yeah, there's been, this is why it's always so funny to me to be told that I'm some kind of Nvidia show.

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:43.840
I like good products.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.840
And so that's not a bias.

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.840
That's not being a fanboy.

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:50.840
Yeah.

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:58.840
That's just evaluating things and then seeing how they are and forming an opinion.

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.840
That's not, that's not bias.

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:05.840
If something is good and you think it's good, that's, that's just fact.

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.840
Right.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:12.840
Like that's, and, and, and again, though, back to what we said before, my fact is not necessarily your fact.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:13.840
Right.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:23.840
If I love this product for gaming and you use some kind of professional software and it's been, they've had this bug for three years that completely ruins your life and you need to use something else.

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.840
That's, that's your life, right?

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.840
Like that's, that's your perspective and that's totally valid, right?

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:36.840
But for me, it doesn't, it doesn't make me a fan to say this is a good product that works really well.

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:40.840
It's expensive, but you got to give it to them.

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.840
It works really well.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.840
Where was I going with this?

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.840
I totally can't remember because my brain is bad.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.840
Right.

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:49.840
Yeah.

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.840
I always get a kick out of it when people think I'm some kind of Nvidia shill.

01:36:52.840 --> 01:37:09.840
Nvidia has done so little sponsored and paid work with us over the years that I don't even think they would register as like, like how many decimal places would we have to get to.

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.840
So you've got percentages of our total, total overall income.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:16.840
And then you've got like a decimal of a percentage.

01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:18.840
I don't even think they'd be at one decimal.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:19.840
I think they'd be at two.

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:23.840
Like they are functionally most years, there's nothing.

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.840
Yeah, they've only worked with us like twice.

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:29.840
Yeah, like actually functionally negligible.

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:30.840
Yeah.

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:48.840
And which made it particularly funny to me when I heard through the grapevine back after the hard run box thing that Nvidia was putting pressure on their partners that they give marketing funds to to not spend those funds with us because even accounting for pass through.

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.840
It's like negligible, like not a non factor.

01:37:54.840 --> 01:38:03.840
So they, they tried to put this allegedly tried to put this I heard from two, two sources though, they tried to put this financial pressure on us after the hard run box thing.

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:06.840
That's another thing is like they apologize to hard run box.

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.840
I never got an apology for that.

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:15.840
So there's been some, I am not a fan of Nvidia and the way that they do business.

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.840
And so I made that very clear.

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:27.840
I made that extremely clear to our new rep that this relationship is not going to be repaired by coming in and saying, you know, it'd be great.

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.840
A fresh start.

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:31.840
Yeah.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:32.840
Yeah, sure.

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:35.840
I guess that would be great.

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:52.840
But you're going to have to figure this out because as far as I can tell, a lot of Nvidia's behaviors are not as simple as one rep going rogue, disrespecting the media and engaging in these mafia thug business tactics.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:58.840
I've seen Nvidia engage with their manufacturing partners in the same way their board partners.

01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:06.840
I've seen Nvidia engage with their retail partners in the same way and video is a cutthroat company.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.840
They are competitive.

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:13.840
They compete and maybe that's a big part of the reason they win so much.

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:22.840
But that doesn't mean that they can't be respectful from while they're while they're competing that doesn't mean they can't share some of the spoils of war.

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:28.840
That's the way that they've squeezed margins for their for their board partners, for example, over the years.

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:37.840
And so I basically said, look, I think that realistically, a lot of the problems I have with Nvidia are not as simple as a fresh start.

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:41.840
I appreciate anything that you think that you can do.

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:46.840
And what I can tell you is I will, I will have an open mind.

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:55.840
You know, I will, I will try to have a fresh start, but you're going to have to understand that there's going to be more to this than just the way that you treat me.

01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:05.840
Right. I just I love this, I love this saying or expression or whatever it is where, you know, a man that's kind to you and rude to a waiter is a rude man.

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.840
Right.

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.840
And I experienced that a lot being being a prominent creator in the tech community.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:31.840
It is pretty easy for me to get prompt service on something, which is a big part of the reason that we do secret shopper, which is a big part of the reason that we are introducing our secret shopping our sponsors series, which is going to be kicking off very soon.

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:42.840
I believe all of the background has been done, but the person who is working on that has other projects. So it's taking some time to get everything compiled and turn it into a script.

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:59.840
But I'm, I'm really, really excited to bring that series to you guys, because we want to we want to know like, are we just getting good treatment because Nvidia wants to project being a nice guy through their treatment of us and turn us into fans.

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:13.840
We've always got to watch out for and, you know, maybe this is, maybe I'm jaded and cynical. Maybe, maybe I'm just experienced. Sometimes I can't tell the difference, but it's the kind of thing that brands do.

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.840
They do it all the time.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.840
And that's not being that's just being realistic.

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:35.840
It was, it was funny because there was another classic brand move that got pulled on this trip that I was a little frustrated with one of our team members for not being aware of. And then I kind of, you know, I kind of went I talked to them yesterday and basically like I had said some some pretty

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:55.840
direct words previously, and I don't take any of them back. You know, you know who you are. It had to you had to hear it. I want you to, I want you to learn. I want you to get more experienced. I want you to, to do better, because like sandwiched a little better though.

01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:59.840
But I could have, I could have done a better job of the poops sandwich.

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:11.840
But you know, these are important life skills, regardless of whether you're going to work here forever, you're going to work somewhere else, you got it, you got to learn these things, you got to take these with you. And so I'm glad I told you but I could have been a bit nicer about it.

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:17.840
But basically, what I said is like, look, brands have their agenda.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:30.840
You have your agenda and you've got to keep these things separate, you've got to understand you don't work for them. And they are going to use every possible trick in the book to manipulate you into doing what they want.

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:36.840
And in this case, it was a sponsored project that was supposed to happen while we were here.

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:48.840
Actually, it was a couple things, but the one that started it was the sponsored project that was supposed to happen here with a big board maker, where I wanted to see a GPU manufacturing line.

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:59.840
And I basically said, sponsorship deal or no sponsorship deal. I'm not going unless we're seeing a GPU manufacturing line, I want to see a GPU go start to finish.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:12.840
And then I want to power it on, kind of like what we did at the micron factory. And in the lead up to the show, you know, I kept being told, okay, yeah, we haven't confirmed exactly what it's going to be.

01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:23.840
We haven't confirmed. We haven't confirmed yet. And I'm like, you need to get this confirmed. You have to get this confirmed. We are flying 11 hours around the world or whatever it is.

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:32.840
And you got to get this confirmed before we go and I can see why it might not have seemed that urgent because we were going to Computex anyway. Yeah, right.

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:48.840
But when you're negotiating something, the more things you leave until the moment when you arrive, the more potential there is for what happened next, which is that on the day we were supposed to go and shoot this video.

01:43:48.840 --> 01:44:06.840
We were contacted in the morning and told, hey, we can't make the GPU manufacturing line work. But what we do have is a new model of GPU that you can show and some cases and some upcoming extremely basic level boring Computex content.

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:10.840
Yeah, like normal, normal Computex.

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:18.840
So yeah, the sponsor deal is still on, but it's going to be this. And I kind of went.

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:32.840
Okay, I made this really clear. When I said before the show that the sponsorship deal is not on unless we are bringing content about GPU manufacturing to the people.

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:50.840
That's not, it's not negotiable. It's not a conversation. I don't want to be talking about this right now because I already told you. And the thing is, like, I'm not trying to be, I'm not trying to be a jerk about it.

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:54.840
But I am beholden to my boss.

01:44:54.840 --> 01:45:07.840
And I don't mean our incoming CEO. I mean, you guys, you guys are the boss. If I upload crap, you guys are going to download it or worse, you're going to not watch it.

01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:18.840
And then we talked about, you know, exponential channel decay. That's going to happen. It's a fight for survival every day. If I bring you guys, regardless of sponsorship dollars, right?

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:34.840
Like that's what I'm, you know, that's what ultimately I have to do. If I want to get sponsorship dollars, I have to find a way to cram those into a project that is entertaining enough for you guys that you want to watch it, regardless of that, right?

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:45.840
So, you know, I will, I will sometimes take a project that I would just love to do. I would just, I would just love to see the micron factory tour. That's actually a great example.

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:55.840
I would have wanted to go regardless of the money, but I'll hold out. I'll basically go. No, it's got to be paid.

01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:02.840
Because realistically, for something like that, they're going to, they're going to need a whole bunch of like NDA, like type of privacy.

01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:15.840
Yeah, privacy control over it anyway. So if they're going to expect all of that, then I'm sitting here going, well, then yeah, then you pay the sponsorship dollar or I'm not going, even though I'm sitting there going, please do it.

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:25.840
Right. So, so that's what happened with this board maker is I basically went, look, I told you we're not going because my boss says that's not interesting enough.

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:43.840
So we aren't going unless this is happening. And I think everyone was sort of taken aback, including the person on my team, who kind of went, oh, when I said, okay, well, we're not going then, we're going to go shoot something else.

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:50.840
And we ended up going to the gigabyte booth where we shot that cool grace super chip video. That was actually that was a lot of fun.

01:46:51.840 --> 01:47:05.840
And later on in the week, we made another attempt at it. And whether it was a miscommunication or whether it was another effort to just get us on site so they could get us to talk about something else again.

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:15.840
We arrived and it wasn't a manufacturing line or even a prototyping line, which is what I thought we were going to see. I thought we were going to see a prototyping line.

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:27.840
It was just like some PCBs and some finished GPUs and soldering iron, which is not how they do it, which is not how they build GPUs at all.

01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:39.840
And so we, we shot a quick short for one of the channels and we just like left and, you know, maybe it was a miscommunication.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:45.840
Maybe it was, you know, maybe they just wanted to get us in there to talk about this other stuff they wanted to talk about.

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:55.840
I'm not sure, but it was it was a really valuable learning experience. I think for the way that the way that brands will will try to get you close or get you in the door.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:06.840
And then once you're already there, kind of go, oh, well, some cost fallacy. You might as well talk about this other thing because, you know, it'd be a shame to sit a bunch, even when you do have a really solid agreement.

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:08.840
It's often attempted.

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:16.840
Yep. Yeah, we had we had an issue with a case manufacturer this year, where we wanted to do something cool with one of their products.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:21.840
And they were showing it at this one location, but we wanted to do something at the other location.

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:31.840
And they didn't want to give us the one that was at the one location for some reason and they basically made us borrowing it contingent on going to their party their their event.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.840
I'm like, OK, I'll go, but I can't stay long because I have a commitment. I'm playing badminton tonight.

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:42.840
And I'm only going to go if there's food because I'm not trying to I'm not trying to be a diva about it.

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:51.840
But I am on my way out the door to get food before I go exercise. I cannot go to exercise before I've eaten.

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:54.840
So I can't go to your event unless there's food there.

01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:02.840
There was no food. There was like like a dozen of the last order that nobody wanted left.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:11.840
And there was and immediately they started trying to brief me on their like products that I didn't come there to talk about.

01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:17.840
And then what's even worse is before we got a chance to do anything with the thing we borrowed, they asked for it back.

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:28.840
And one of our team members went full just like errand person for them and like brought it back to them when we would have been going the next morning anyway.

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:35.840
And I was like, so that was again, you know, like, hey, these are the moves brands pull they try they try and make you their beta.

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:42.840
And you can't you can't be there for that. It's the answer is the answer is no. And it's not about being a jerk.

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:48.840
It's about standing your ground, right? And I don't know, maybe it's just like, is it like a like a Canadian cultural thing?

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:51.840
Just like wanting to be a people pleaser.

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:54.840
Did I used to be more like that? Have I just?

01:49:54.840 --> 01:50:02.840
No, have I just gotten well, okay, then I think I think back in the day the video would have been made.

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:08.840
But I think for different reasons, I think back in the day we we valued volume very highly.

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:12.840
Yeah, so we just get a lot of content out all the time.

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:22.840
So like, it's always, it's always kind of funny to me when people talk about how much better our content used to be when we used to focus on

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:29.840
videos from show talking about sure dude, we upload less now than ever.

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:34.840
We used to have a thing at CES where you had 30 minutes per appointment and that included travel time.

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:37.840
Yeah, which could be switching hotels.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:40.840
Yeah.

01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:44.840
Like, there was not time for quality, my dude.

01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:45.840
Yeah.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:53.840
Man, looking back at old videos, like there were certainly some fun and funny just dragon energy things that happened.

01:50:53.840 --> 01:51:01.840
But I don't know about, I don't know if quality is the right word to describe anything that we used to do compared to what we do today.

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:02.840
Yeah.

01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.840
This is an impromptu topic.

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.840
Sorry, I'm kind of blind siding you with this.

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:13.840
But I wanted to talk about why we didn't cover one of the big pieces of news at the show this year.

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:18.840
This was another sort of having to having to draw a line in the sand.

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:22.840
We were supposed to get seven videos this week.

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:39.840
And we ultimately didn't end up making one of them because partly through my own error, we arrived at a booth and realized that the people that we were about to cover had ripped off the community in the past.

01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:40.840
Yeah.

01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:47.840
And I had, you know, not intentionally, but I had been complicit.

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:49.840
And

01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:52.840
Yeah, and that's not going to happen again.

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:57.840
So one of the one of the big things that the show was this super cool and I saw it.

01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.840
I was briefed on it.

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:01.840
It's super cool.

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:17.840
But this collaborative case between Strykom and Kaleos that's capable of dissipating, they say 600, but actually it's more like 700 Watts passively, depending on

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.840
the thermal output of your CPU and GPU.

01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:31.840
So it has two loops and they're identical, but they rate, I think the CPU one slightly lower just because most CPUs are not going to hit that level anyway or something like that.

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:37.840
I forget there's some, there's some reason that one of them is like rated a little bit lower when they talk about the product overall.

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:46.840
But actually, if you had a differently balanced system, it could it could even dissipate a little bit more heat.

01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:51.840
Oh, right. So first, let's talk about who these folks are. So Strykom, tons of respect.

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:52.840
I love those guys.

01:52:52.840 --> 01:53:01.840
They do just a great, great job of manufacturing super sleek aluminum cases and accessories and stuff like that.

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:11.840
In fact, they make the test benches that we use for lab, really cool modular test benches that like pack flat, awesome.

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:13.840
Actually, hold on.

01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:16.840
Yeah, sort of that is Strykom, right?

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:19.840
Yeah, yeah, the open bench table. Yeah, that thing is sick.

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.840
Cool. So Strykom makes that.

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:28.840
Love those guys.

01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.840
Now let's talk about Callios.

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:38.840
Do you guys remember the passive like 300 watt or 350 watt case from like six years ago?

01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:39.840
Kickstarter campaign.

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:41.840
Do you remember this thing?

01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:43.840
It was pumpless, which was super cool.

01:53:43.840 --> 01:54:02.840
So it's full of refrigerant and then the heat from the CPU or well, I mean, or GPU and GPU, whatever would force would cause the refrigerant to evaporate and then it would start moving and then it would condense and then it would, it would actually start flowing on its own without any kind of pumping system.

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:06.840
So the whole thing was completely silent, super cool tech.

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:28.840
They raised a quarter million dollars on Kickstarter, give or take, and then ghosted nobody who bought one of those original cases ever got anything for their money as far as I can tell, and this was a significant amount of money.

01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:31.840
This case was over $500 on average, right?

01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:38.840
Because remember Kickstarter, there's the different tiers depending on how early you, how early you fund it.

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:42.840
And I covered the case.

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.840
In fact, I covered them twice.

01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:49.840
Once I covered the case, actually, it might have been three times.

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:53.840
I don't, I don't remember anymore, but I definitely covered it at least twice.

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:59.840
I covered the case in our studio and tested it and it was amazing and super cool.

01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:08.840
And then I covered another collaborative project they were doing on like a smaller cube passive system later on at a trade show at CES or something like that.

01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:15.840
And I took a lot of, so okay, yeah, people are, people are in the chat here.

01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:17.840
I thought they, I thought they collapsed.

01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:20.840
Well, no, they didn't.

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:26.840
Callios did existed before and still exists now.

01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:35.840
I mean, their main business is, is B2B cooling solutions like silent passive cooling solutions.

01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:46.840
And they, they work in all kinds of different industries, including like they have some history in the aerospace industry, for example.

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:51.840
And so they, they, they had the experience with cooling and they had the, the backing.

01:55:51.840 --> 01:56:04.840
They had the reputation as a real company that made me comfortable promoting this as a product that genuinely would exist where they would overcome the challenges and actually deliver these to people.

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:09.840
And they just didn't, they just didn't deliver them.

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:18.840
And I want to tell both sides of the story here because I actually had the Callios founder and I also had the new CEO of Callios there in the booth with me.

01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:25.840
And they basically went like, look, we spent three times the amount of the Kickstarter backers trying to make this thing happen.

01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:27.840
There were challenges we didn't foresee.

01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:29.840
We were naive.

01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:31.840
It was a smaller team.

01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:37.840
And I'm sorry we didn't deliver anything, but it was Kickstarter.

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:45.840
And I kind of went, okay, that's not really how that works.

01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.840
But what about people's money?

01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.840
And they're like, okay, we have a solution for that.

01:56:51.840 --> 01:57:04.840
And I go, okay, I would like to hear your solution because I basically got the briefing and I told them, we have two, we have two paths here.

01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:08.840
Either you tell me how you're going to make this right.

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:10.840
And it's actually good.

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:12.840
And I make a video about this.

01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:15.840
Or you don't tell me how you're going to make this right.

01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:20.840
And I walk away and I'm not acknowledging your company here.

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:24.840
And they go, okay, no, no, we have a solution for this.

01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:33.840
For everyone who backs the original case, they will get a voucher for the full amount of their backing toward the new case.

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:38.840
And I went on the surface, that sounds possibly pretty okay.

01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:41.840
To note that it's not a whole new case though.

01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.840
What's the delta here?

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:47.840
Well, the new case can dissipate about double the heat.

01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:49.840
And it's a much nicer looking design.

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:50.840
It's lighter.

01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:58.840
However, however, the new case is priced according to its heat dissipation capabilities.

01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:05.840
So they were offering a credit of $500 change, $500 essentially.

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:12.840
Let's say, let's say $575 towards a $1,000 case.

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:19.840
And I'm sitting here going.

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:20.840
This is interesting.

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:26.840
Shotkey in Twitch chat has a has an uncharacteristically terrible take for Twitch chat.

01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:27.840
And that's really something.

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:29.840
So you blackmailed them.

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.840
No, I didn't blackmail them.

01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:33.840
That's not what blackmail is.

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:34.840
You should go look up.

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:35.840
Sort of.

01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:40.840
Anyway, that's amazing how confused people get sometimes.

01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:44.840
So sorry, they offered.

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:46.840
So they're offering, let's say 600.

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:47.840
Let's round up.

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:51.840
They're offering a $600 voucher for $1,000 product.

01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:53.840
And I kind of went.

01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:55.840
So are you serious right now?

01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:57.840
You took my money.

01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:59.840
Let's say hypothetically, I'm one of these buyers.

01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:04.840
You took my money, my significant amount of money six years ago.

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:11.840
And you're coming back to me now saying, no, but we're really going to ship you something this time.

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:16.840
All we need is double your money, more money.

01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:22.840
Needless to say, I wasn't happy with that.

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:24.840
I didn't consider that acceptable.

01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:28.840
I said, that's a good option that people should have.

01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:35.840
But at the end of the day, they need to also have the option to have their money back.

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:42.840
Because the way that it works is if you're a real company that behaves like a real company,

01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:49.840
when you take someone's money and you don't ship them a product, then you should give them their money back.

01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:51.840
And they kind of went, yeah, but it was Kickstarter.

01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:53.840
It was a small team.

01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:56.840
It was an offshoot Skunk Works project.

01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:02.840
I go, okay, but this is your integrity we're talking about.

02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:05.840
I'm not talking about your legal obligations here.

02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:11.840
I'm talking about your integrity as a company, as a person.

02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:19.840
The right thing to do if you take someone's money and don't deliver it and don't deliver the product is to give them their money back.

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:25.840
This is when I was talking to the founder and they basically went, look, I have to discuss this with the new CEO.

02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:26.840
Let me get back to you.

02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:32.840
I said, okay, well, I'm going to go check out the rest of the show floor, see if there's anything else cool to cover.

02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:34.840
And we'll go from there.

02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:36.840
And you just, here's my cell.

02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:39.840
Just give me a call when you guys have had a chance to talk about it.

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:41.840
And we'll go from there.

02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:47.840
So I get a call a few hours later and classic brand tactics.

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.840
They go, okay, we've talked about it.

02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:50.840
We've come to a solution.

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:51.840
I'm like, okay, cool.

02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:52.840
What is it?

02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:55.840
And they're like, why don't you swing by the booth?

02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:58.840
And I go, why don't we just talk about it on the phone?

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.840
Because it should be a simple answer.

02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.840
If the news was good, they would just tell me.

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:09.840
But I was like, realistically, you know what, Andy and Jake are about to order food.

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:11.840
Get me one of whatever Jake's having.

02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.840
And I'm going to hobble over to the booth.

02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:20.840
And I, and I, and I will, I will tell them no in their faces because whatever.

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.840
I'm not, I'm not afraid of that.

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:27.840
If they think that bringing me there is going to somehow make me change my line in the sand that I've drawn,

02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:29.840
then they've got something else coming.

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:32.840
So sure, I'll play your game.

02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:37.840
So I get there and they tell me, okay, you know, what if it was, you know,

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:40.840
what if it was some kind of, you know,

02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:45.840
share in the, what if they got a, what if in addition to the discount,

02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:48.840
they got some kind of share in the profits of the new product.

02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:53.840
I'm sitting here going, what are you even talking about?

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:59.840
Yeah, I know that I had discussed how Kickstarter is sort of dumb because it's basically,

02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:04.840
you know, investment where you don't get any equity, right?

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:08.840
Because it's, it's, it's either buying a product or it's kind of that.

02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:15.840
Right. And you can't, both of them are sort of, well, buying a product is fine unless the product doesn't get delivered,

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:18.840
in which case it's basically just taking people's money, right?

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:26.840
And I kind of went, yeah, I mean, hey, thanks for playing, but that's actually not how this works.

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:31.840
If you guys are a real company with integrity, then what you do is you give them back their money.

02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.840
I also run a physical goods business.

02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:35.840
We also make mistakes from time to time.

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:38.840
And when we do, we eat it.

02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:45.840
You can always offer like, oh, if you don't take a refund and you take a credit towards the next thing,

02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:48.840
we'll like bump up its value by a small amount.

02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:50.840
Or not even, if you're happy with the credit, take the credit.

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:51.840
That too.

02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:53.840
But getting a refund needs to be an option.

02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:54.840
Yeah, it should be possible.

02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:55.840
And I understand what they're saying.

02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:56.840
They made a car comparison.

02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:02.840
They were like, you know, we originally sold a Citroen and now we're shipping a BMW.

02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:05.840
Just like ship everyone who paid for a Citroen and BMW.

02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:06.840
Yeah, totally.

02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:07.840
Yeah, 100%.

02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:08.840
So refund them.

02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:09.840
So refund them.

02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.840
Because you didn't ship the Citroen.

02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:12.840
You never shipped it.

02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:13.840
Yeah.

02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:21.840
And so the really baffling thing about this to me is that Callius is a real company

02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:25.840
and they really do add any integrity whatsoever.

02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:29.840
This is such a small price to pay.

02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:33.840
The total backing was about a quarter million dollars.

02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:34.840
There's a lot of money.

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:38.840
There's a lot of money on like big manufacturing business scale.

02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:48.840
But if you're looking to just put this in the past for real, do it properly.

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:54.840
And if you want a PR win, you basically say, look, yeah, we'll offer you a refund.

02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:57.840
But we actually think it's a better play.

02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:02.840
If you take the credit and get this much better case, they probably convert a lot of people

02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.840
to the new case.

02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:07.840
But they're trying to, they're trying to eat their cake and have it too.

02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:11.840
They're trying to just keep money from people who are not going to use the credit for the

02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:12.840
case.

02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:17.840
Seem like they're looking like good guys and launch this new case and kind of go, well,

02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:20.840
we tried.

02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:27.840
Because none of those people are, unless they actually, you know, offer a refund are going

02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:29.840
to be interested in their new promises.

02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:30.840
And you know what?

02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:31.840
It might be different this time.

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:33.840
Streetcom is sure as me, it'll be different.

02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:38.840
I trust them still because they're the manufacturing partner helping bring this thing to life.

02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:43.840
And I feel bad for Streetcom because it seems like they came into this having done nothing

02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:48.840
wrong ultimately, just recognizing this is a super cool technology and wanting to bring

02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:49.840
it to gamers.

02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:51.840
So I feel bad for them, right?

02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:57.840
But no, at the end of the day, this is not a Kickstarter.

02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:03.840
There's a big difference for me between a Kickstarter from like a dude in a basement trying to build

02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:07.840
a hammer that turns into a crowbar.

02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:15.840
And just ultimately not being able to figure it out and a company launching a product on

02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:18.840
Kickstarter or launching a new product category on Kickstarter.

02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:25.840
In terms of the trust that I have and my expectation that this company will behave in a way that

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:29.840
is, that protects their reputation, right?

02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:32.840
Because at the end of the day, it's all trust me, bro.

02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:38.840
So with a company that has some kind of established reputation, I look at it and I go, well, you

02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:42.840
probably want to maintain that so I can probably safely hand you my money.

02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:44.840
And in this case, that was not the case at all.

02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:48.840
And that's kind of a funny pun because there was no case at all.

02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:49.840
They never shipped one.

02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:53.840
And I basically said, look, we're not going to do it.

02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:59.840
So that's my...

02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:02.840
There is still no update on the hammer, by the way.

02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:03.840
I just checked.

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:09.840
The last update says we're back June 4th, 2022.

02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:13.840
We're almost at the one year anniversary of that.

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:14.840
We're going to get there.

02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:19.840
It's too bad because I really...

02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:20.840
Yeah.

02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:21.840
Yeah.

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.840
Here's a much better Twitch take from Tom Smith.

02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:29.840
If you see an ad for a $600 case and you go to the store and they say instead you have to buy a $1,000

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:31.840
case, that's called bait and switch.

02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:33.840
And that's even without collecting any money.

02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:34.840
Yeah.

02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:40.840
And yes, I know Kickstarter's terms do shield them from any kind of legal liability here.

02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:42.840
Yeah, but why would you trust that company?

02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:50.840
The law is not the be all and end all of how we should treat each other.

02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:51.840
Yeah.

02:06:51.840 --> 02:07:00.840
Like by law, I'm allowed to...

02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:05.840
You can be kind of a dick bag and still not break the law.

02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:08.840
That doesn't make it right.

02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:09.840
Yeah.

02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:10.840
Yeah.

02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:11.840
I mean, if you ever...

02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:12.840
Yeah.

02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:14.840
Flow point chat is like laws are not morality.

02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:17.840
Legal does not equal ethical stuff like that.

02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:18.840
Yes.

02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:19.840
Law is the bare minimum.

02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:20.840
Yes.

02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:21.840
Yeah.

02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:22.840
Yeah.

02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:23.840
So we didn't cover it.

02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:25.840
And it's too bad.

02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:34.840
But I just think at the end of the day, they had an opportunity to relatively cheaply actually put this behind them.

02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:37.840
I really wanted to cover the product, not just today, but going forward.

02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:38.840
I want one.

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:39.840
I want one.

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:42.840
I actually want one.

02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:44.840
And I wanted the views on it.

02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:47.840
Even if I was certain it would show up at this one, I would not personally buy one.

02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:48.840
I wanted the views.

02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:49.840
Yeah.

02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:50.840
Yeah.

02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:52.840
But would you buy one if they offered a refund to everyone who didn't get one?

02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:53.840
Mm-hmm.

02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:54.840
Okay.

02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:55.840
We'll see.

02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:56.840
That's what I'm talking about.

02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:57.840
Well, okay.

02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:58.840
I'm not like guaranteeing I would go and purchase one immediately.

02:07:58.840 --> 02:07:59.840
But you would consider one.

02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:00.840
But I would definitely consider it.

02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:01.840
Because it is super cool.

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:02.840
It's a very cool product.

02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:03.840
It's sweet.

02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:04.840
So like, yeah.

02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:05.840
It's very impossible.

02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:07.840
It's very possible.

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:10.840
What's also possible is for us to tell you about our sponsors.

02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:11.840
Oh.

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:12.840
Dan.

02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:13.840
Hello, Dan.

02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.840
Daniel Besser.

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:15.840
Hello.

02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:16.840
Are you set up for this?

02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:17.840
Yeah.

02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:18.840
Mr. Besser.

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:19.840
Hello.

02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:20.840
Mm-hmm.

02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:23.840
Hello, Daniel.

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:25.840
Can you actually not hear me?

02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:26.840
Can you hear me?

02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:27.840
No, we can hear you.

02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:30.840
Well, I wasn't going to tell you.

02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:31.840
I refuse.

02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:34.840
We can hear you, but we can't see anything.

02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.840
So you kind of just got to tell us when to go.

02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:37.840
Yeah.

02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:38.840
Sorry.

02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:40.840
That's my favorite super villain.

02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:43.840
We don't actually have any Dennis integrations today.

02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:46.840
So just needs.

02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:47.840
All right.

02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:48.840
Well, let's read then.

02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:52.840
Backblaze is an affordable and easy to use cloud backup solution

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:54.840
that starts at just $7 a month.

02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:56.840
How are they still at just $7 a month to start?

02:08:56.840 --> 02:08:57.840
It's pretty wild.

02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:58.840
Seriously though.

02:08:58.840 --> 02:08:59.840
We use backblaze.

02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:00.840
Yeah.

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:01.840
Is that on our talking points?

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:02.840
Yeah, we actually use backblaze a lot.

02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:03.840
Backblaze is sick.

02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:06.840
They make it simple, allowing you to back up almost anything from

02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:09.840
your Mac or PC and accessing it from anywhere in the world with

02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:11.840
their web and mobile apps.

02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:12.840
They don't even, oh yeah.

02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:13.840
Okay.

02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:14.840
You can also easily protect your business data through

02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:17.840
essentially managed admin and they'll let you restore your data

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:20.840
for free via the web or even by mail.

02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:22.840
They will ship you a hard drive with your data right to your

02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:23.840
door.

02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:25.840
And when you're done, you can return the hard drive for a refund.

02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:28.840
And if you're worried about accidentally deleting files, you

02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:32.840
can increase your retention history to a year for, get this,

02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:35.840
an extra $2 a month.

02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:38.840
I'm sure we must pay more than that for extra retention or do we

02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:40.840
even have extra retention?

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:43.840
I don't know if that's off my head, but we pay a lot more than

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:46.840
that because we use multiple services and we use them for

02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:48.840
multiple companies at this point.

02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:51.840
Flow plane backs up to them, Linus Media Group backs up to them.

02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:52.840
Right.

02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:53.840
Yeah.

02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:56.840
With over 55 billion files restored and two exabytes of data

02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:58.840
under the management, backblazes got you covered.

No credit card required trial.

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:10.840
I can't endorse backblaze strongly.

02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:11.840
Yeah, we like backblaze.

02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:13.840
We have also liked backblaze for a long time.

02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:15.840
We also like Squarespace.

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:16.840
Yeah.

02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:17.840
We actually use Squarespace too.

02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:18.840
Yep.

02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:19.840
If you're looking at creating and sharing your own content

02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:21.840
online, give Squarespace a try.

Finally, the show is brought to you by Black Point Cyber.

02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:05.840
So, Luke, say my talking points.

02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:08.840
As much as you had a blast during the whole hackening debacle,

02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:12.840
I think we can both agree that cyber attacks are bad.

02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:14.840
Yes.

02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.840
Well, the former national security experts at Black Point

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:20.840
Security, Black Point Cyber also agree.

02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:22.840
And that's what drove them to become a leading

02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.840
cybersecurity company specializing in advanced threat

02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:28.840
detection and response solutions for managed service providers.

02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:30.840

Their advanced threat detection and response capability

02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:40.840
is at the core of their services, enabling them to quickly

02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:43.840
identify and mitigate any security breaches on-premises

02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.840
or in the cloud while their continuous monitoring

02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:48.840
ensures that all systems are always protected.

02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:51.840

02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:56.840
So, why wait?

02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:58.840
You, too, can operate with an elite end-to-end cybersecurity

02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:00.840
strategy.

02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:04.840
To learn more, you can check out the link down below.

02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:07.840
All right.

02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:09.840
Dan, what are we supposed to do now?

02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:12.840
We've got three more March messages.

02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:15.840
Is it weird just sitting in the studio by yourself?

02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:17.840
No, I'm hanging out with AJ.

02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:19.840
With people on the internet?

02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:21.840
Is AJ here?

02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:24.840
So, I don't look like a crazy person laughing to myself

02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:26.840
in an empty warehouse.

02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:28.840
Is AJ just sitting on the set?

02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:30.840
Yeah, we're eating some sushi together.

02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:32.840
It's really nice.

02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:34.840
Are you both sitting on the set?

02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:35.840
Are you in my spot?

02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:37.840
Absolutely not, no, sir.

02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:40.840
I have a backup technical difficulties line

02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:42.840
sitting in your spot.

02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:45.840
I think he has a better spot than me anyway.

02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:48.840
His desk actually fits legs under it.

02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:51.840
My spot is really uncomfortable.

02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:54.840
I was mostly making a big bang theory reference.

02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:56.840
People are allowed to sit in my chair.

02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:59.840
I feel like I have to explain that because the number of people

02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:01.840
that take what I say seriously strikes me.

02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:04.840
Yeah, I pick it up, too.

02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:06.840
I'm also not serious.

02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:08.840
Yeah, I sit in his chair all the time.

02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:10.840
Don't look at me like that.

02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:12.840
Dan, we've talked about this.

02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:14.840
Just to make sure there's a certain level of equality.

02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:16.840
The whole company, after Monday morning meeting,

02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:19.840
actually at one by one, make sure that everyone sits

02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:21.840
in Linus' chair for at least 15 seconds.

02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:24.840
Because you're not on Monday.

02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:26.840
What are we doing?

02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:27.840
Where am I?

02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:28.840
Oh, yeah, merge messages.

02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:29.840
All right, so we've got three to go.

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:30.840
Yeah, hit me.

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:31.840
Your thoughts.

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:34.840
You once had a video on object recognition in surveillance

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:37.840
systems using AI neural network A6.

02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:40.840
Do you see dedicated AI chips being all over devices

02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:42.840
in the next decade?

02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:44.840
Absolutely.

02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:45.840
100%.

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:47.840
I mean, we're already seeing it.

02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.840
Intel, oh, in fact, I think one of the topics in the dark is,

02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:54.840
or no, rather a topic we decided not to talk about,

02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:57.840
but is pretty cool anyway, I guess,

02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:00.840
is that Intel showed off stable diffusion

02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:07.840
running on their new AI-accelerated Meteor Lake chip.

02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:12.840
And that's, it's like what Luke said about how,

02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:17.840
like, private, you know, private machine learning models

02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:20.840
are going to be really important going forward.

02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:23.840
So being able to just, like, generate an image.

02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:25.840
I mean, you might not even, would you,

02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:29.840
would you still need an internet connection?

02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:30.840
Maybe?

02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:31.840
Maybe not.

02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:32.840
Wait, for what?

02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:35.840
To just, to just generate an image.

02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:37.840
As long, yeah, I mean, as long as you have enough storage

02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:39.840
for the model.

02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:40.840
Yeah.

02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:45.840
So, huh, I mean, they'll probably make you go through the cloud

02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:46.840
anyway.

02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:47.840
Well, and you could, you could retrain.

02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:48.840
So like you could,

02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:51.840
Looking at you Google freaking voice assistant anyway.

02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:52.840
Sorry.

02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:53.840
No, but like stable diffusion itself,

02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:56.840
you can download run it offline entirely.

02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:57.840
Oh, I've never tried.

02:14:57.840 --> 02:14:58.840
I didn't know that.

02:14:58.840 --> 02:14:59.840
Okay.

02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:00.840
Yeah, cool.

02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:01.840
So yeah, being able to do that faster.

02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:03.840
I mean, yeah, we're going to see that in your laptop.

02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:06.840
And we've been seeing, we've been seeing,

02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:09.840
like machine learning course built into phones for quite some

02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:12.840
time, doing everything from, you know, trying to optimize your

02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:16.840
battery life to optimizing your, your photography, right?

02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:20.840
Like, yes, AI tips in all the things, whether you like it or

02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:21.840
not.

02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:22.840
Oh yeah.

02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:23.840
That's absolutely.

02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:24.840
A little bit different here.

02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:29.840
How did the short circuit channel get its name?

02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:36.840
I want to say James is the one who came up with it.

02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:39.840
Because I think I talked about this once in the past.

02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:41.840
And I thought it was me or something.

02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:43.840
And then I think he corrected me,

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:47.840
but I could have this memory completely wrong.

02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:50.840
And Gmail search is useless now.

02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:51.840
Oh yeah.

02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:52.840
There's no way you're going to find it.

02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:56.840
So if I were to try to find just the first reference to short

02:15:56.840 --> 02:15:58.840
circuit in my inbox,

02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:01.840
that might just be impossible.

02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:03.840
Oh, good.

02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:07.840
Johnno used to have short circuit in his stupid email signature.

02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:11.840
So I have every email I ever got from Johnno here.

02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:15.840
Perfect.

02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:17.840
I don't think you're going to find it.

02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:21.840
I mean, isn't it kind of worth a shot to see the,

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.840
the conversation that we had around it?

02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:24.840
Here we go.

02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:25.840
Top names for new channel.

02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:31.840
Oh, wait.

02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:32.840
Whoa.

02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:35.840
So the name came from Riley.

02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:37.840
So this is when we were.

02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:38.840
Okay.

02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:39.840
Okay.

02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:40.840
This is fun.

02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:42.840
Top names for new channel is the subject line from Mr.

02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:43.840
Nick light.

02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:44.840
February, 2018.

02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:48.840
Because apparently we might end up using these in the future.

02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:50.840
We're not going to use any of these.

02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:51.840
Um,

02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:54.840
tech linked or clinked pronounced clinked.

02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:57.840
So it's like an abbreviated CH like tech link.

02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:00.840
Uh, we didn't end up with clinked cause that was dumb.

02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:04.840
Um, tech brief, brief tech, brink of tech, tech point.

02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:06.840
Uh, it's kind of like a tip.

02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:09.840
Um, best and latest in tech BLT.

02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:11.840
We have always liked the acronyms.

02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:12.840
Quickie news.

02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:13.840
Quickie news.

02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:15.840
Ah, that quickie news held on for a little while.

02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:16.840
Yeah.

02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:17.840
I remember that.

02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:19.840
Um, the cash.

02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:21.840
And then I, I reply.

02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:24.840
I actually liked tech linked best out of them adding Riley for

02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:25.840
his thoughts.

02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:29.840
Uh, the three that I kind of liked for tech linked tech point and

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:30.840
quickie news.

02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:32.840
And then let's see.

02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:36.840
Riley pitched in with, I gotta say, I find myself gravitating

02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:37.840
toward tech linked as well.

02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:40.840
We were trying not to do tech linked because it's just,

02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:41.840
it's so close to net link.

02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:42.840
Well, but that was why.

02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:43.840
Yeah.

02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:44.840
Like that.

02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:48.840
We're just like, what if instead of net linked, it was just

02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:49.840
tech link.

02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:56.840
Anyway, we, even though it was my suggestion, I was also kind of

02:17:56.840 --> 02:17:57.840
trying not to do it.

02:17:57.840 --> 02:17:58.840
This one's pretty good.

02:17:58.840 --> 02:17:59.840
I wouldn't say that.

02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:02.840
So Riley pitches in, he goes, yeah, I find myself gravitating

02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:03.840
towards it as well.

02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:06.840
But I feel like there's so many shows and sites that have tech in

02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:07.840
the name.

02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:08.840
So I'd be less inclined to want that.

02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:11.840
I've got a couple more to throw in the pot.

02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:14.840
And one of them is a really good idea that we might use someday.

02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:15.840
So we're not going to say that one.

02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:18.840
But he goes, what about short circuit?

02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:24.840
That is the first reference to short circuit.

02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:27.840
So I think it must have been Riley.

02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:30.840
We had some discussion.

02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:37.840
Short circuit lost because of the movie dot, dot, dot problem.

02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:41.840
Kind of sounds like inside track, which is good.

02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:44.840
But the movie problems, there's a movie called short circuit.

02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:47.840
So we made our name.

02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:50.840
Ultimately, when we launched short circuit, totally different by

02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:51.840
making it.

02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:52.840
One word.

02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:53.840
Got him.

02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:54.840
Yeah.

02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:55.840
That's wild.

02:18:55.840 --> 02:19:00.840
I did not know that it was Riley, but it appears that it was

02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:01.840
totally Riley.

02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:03.840
Whether we realize it or not.

02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:04.840
Is it possible?

02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:05.840
Oh, okay.

02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:06.840
Hold on.

02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:07.840
Short circuit branding discussion.

02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:08.840
What is this?

02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:12.840
This is a doc.

02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:13.840
Meeting notes.

02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:14.840
This is amazing.

02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:17.840
I love just like poking around at the solar panel.

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:19.840
Our objective for this meeting attendance.

02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:21.840
Nick, John O. James and Linus objective.

02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:24.840
Establish a baseline for the new channel's logo and branding

02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:25.840
direction.

02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:26.840
Meeting notes.

02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:28.840
Should the name be one word or two?

02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:29.840
Linus wants it.

02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:31.840
Wants it one word name and he likes it.

02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:33.840
This is someone else's notes.

02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:35.840
Nick, it should be in all caps if it's one word.

02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:36.840
Linus wants one word.

02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:37.840
Big S, big C.

02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:39.840
I guess I won that executive flex.

02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:41.840
Short circuit.

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.840
Big S, big C.

02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:45.840
The reason I care about that.

02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:49.840
I wasn't just trying to be a jerk about it and just be like,

02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:50.840
no, this way.

02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:52.840
Because I like being able to abbreviate things.

02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:55.840
S C is easier when you.

02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:57.840
Like clearly see the SC.

02:19:57.840 --> 02:19:59.840
Next step, color than graphics colors.

02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:01.840
Pink and yellow says Linus.

02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:02.840
Baby blue and pink.

02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:03.840
I'm not sure.

02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:04.840
I clearly see the SC.

02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:06.840
Next step, color than graphics colors.

02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:08.840
Pink and yellow says Linus.

02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:10.840
Baby blue and pink says Nick.

02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:12.840
Linus wants eye searing.

02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:14.840
Nick says yellow is very aggressive.

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:17.840
And if you're looking at it on a screen, it can be offensive.

02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:19.840
Linus wants to see options.

02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:21.840
Yellow and pink, baby blue and pink.

02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:23.840
What did we ultimately end up with?

02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:24.840
I think so.

02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:32.840
Or baby blue, pink, orange and purple and white.

02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:33.840
So that's something.

02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:34.840
And yellow.

02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:35.840
And yellow.

02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:36.840
They're all in there.

02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:37.840
Every color.

02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:40.840
No green, no red, no navy.

02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:43.840
And yeah, I think none of those ended up making it.

02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:45.840
80s styling, digital branding.

02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:47.840
Both of those kind of stayed.

02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:48.840
Yeah.

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:49.840
This is so cool.

02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:51.840
How did things come to be?

02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:52.840
There you go.

02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:56.840
These are the kinds of meetings that we have that I never want to

02:20:56.840 --> 02:20:58.840
have again.

02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:01.840
Like, I shouldn't even say that because I do.

02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:04.840
I do enjoy the creative process.

02:21:04.840 --> 02:21:05.840
You like some of that stuff.

02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:07.840
And that actually does fall under vision officer service.

02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:08.840
So good luck with that.

02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:10.840
I just, I can't do all of it.

02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:11.840
That's the thing.

02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:13.840
I can't be in every one of these meetings anymore.

02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:14.840
Yeah.

02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:15.840
Like it's exhausting.

02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:19.840
I'd rather be on the camera on short circuit.

02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:20.840
All right, Dan, hit me.

02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:21.840
Sure thing.

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:22.840
That's where you have like channel managers.

02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:23.840
Like, sorry, one second.

02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:26.840
That's where you have like channel managers because like Riley is

02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:28.840
working on game linked, right?

02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:29.840
Yep.

02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:32.840
He's the channel manager for linked in general, as far as my

02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:33.840
understanding goes.

02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:37.840
So like, I'm sure he has more play into the, that type of, like,

02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:41.840
were you involved in the picking of the primary colors for game

02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:42.840
linked?

02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:43.840
No.

02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:44.840
Yeah.

02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:45.840
So we moved on.

02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:48.840
I actually first saw the logo live on WAN show when I was like,

02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:49.840
oh, there's a channel for it.

02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:50.840
Yeah.

02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:54.840
By the way, it's driving Riley crazy how much I keep talking about

02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:56.840
game linked on WAN show.

02:21:56.840 --> 02:22:00.840
Cause dang it, Linus, it's not ready for launch yet.

02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:03.840
So if you want to, if you want to bother him, go subscribe to

02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:04.840
game linked.

02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:05.840
Yeah.

02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:09.840
Because the more subscribers are on it, the more he's like, oh,

02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:13.840
Linus, can you keep talking about game linked?

02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:16.840
I wanted to do a big, a big surprise launch.

02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:17.840
The surprise is over.

02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:20.840
So you might as well get subscribed so that at least he can

02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:24.840
launch the first video and it can get a ton of views because you

02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:26.840
will all get a notification and you can watch it.

02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:28.840
And it's going to be awesome because it's going to be tech

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:32.840
linked with games and you guys are going to love it.

02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:33.840
Oh, right.

02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:34.840
The pool.

02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:35.840
Okay.

02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:37.840
Dan, don't let me forget to talk about that after this one more

02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:38.840
merge message.

02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:39.840
Okay.

02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:40.840
Hey, LD.

02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:44.840
I love to see Luke back on camera and the two of you work,

02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:46.840
you two of you really work well together.

02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:49.840
What were some challenges with Luke returning and will we see

02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:53.840
more of him, perhaps a short circuit?

02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:57.840
It was really hard to walk from the WAN set over.

02:22:57.840 --> 02:22:59.840
That was very tough.

02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:02.840
Especially because you were waiting for WAN to start anyway when

02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:04.840
we did that PC cleaning products video.

02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:05.840
Yep.

02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:08.840
I mean, if we're going to be late for WAN, we might as well

02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:09.840
both be late for WAN.

02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:10.840
Yeah.

02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:12.840
Yeah, I don't know.

02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:15.840
What were the challenges with, with your returning?

02:23:15.840 --> 02:23:17.840
I genuinely don't know.

02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:21.840
I think the biggest challenge with bringing Luke back on camera

02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:24.840
is that compared to when he used to be on camera,

02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:27.840
he has a lot of work to do now.

02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:28.840
Oh, yeah.

02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:30.840
I don't have the time to do it consistently.

02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:32.840
There's no way.

02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:33.840
Yeah.

02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:36.840
I'm excited about game links because the prospect of being

02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:39.840
able to just like, and tech linked and stuff like that where I

02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:41.840
can just show up on set, do it really quickly and then leave

02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:44.840
and go back to what I'm doing is like a lot more feasible than

02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:47.840
even go through the whole process for like an LCD video or

02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:48.840
something.

02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:51.840
And that kind of worked in, in this scenario that we're talking

02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:54.840
about with the, with the cleaning products video, because

02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:56.840
like you said, I was just waiting for WAN anyways.

02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:59.840
So my, my work was pretty ineffective.

02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:02.840
So it was like, God, I can wait over there and like clean

02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:03.840
some stuff.

02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:04.840
So it just worked.

02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:05.840
I don't know.

02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:06.840
But yeah, I got a lot of stuff to do.

02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:08.840
I don't, I can't do videos all the time.

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:09.840
I enjoy it.

02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:10.840
It's fun.

02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:11.840
But yeah.

02:24:11.840 --> 02:24:12.840
All right.

02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:13.840
Pool.

02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:19.840
So the pool company we contracted is GRN pool and landscape.

02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:24.840
And it has been two years.

02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:25.840
We checked.

02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:26.840
Okay.

02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:31.840
It has actually been two years since we got the original

02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:37.840
like documentation and sent a deposit to begin work on our

02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:42.840
project.

02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:48.840
And at the time they had pretty good reviews and seemed very

02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:52.840
knowledgeable and professional things were moving along quite

02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:55.840
quickly when it came to, you know, selecting materials and,

02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:58.840
and design and, and all of that kind of stuff.

02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:02.840
And we actually ended up starting with pool and awarding them

02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:08.840
landscaping stuff as well, which now we're not doing with them

02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:09.840
anymore.

02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:10.840
Do any of that?

02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:11.840
Yeah.

02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:15.840
So all the stuff that changed in like the outside so far has

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:16.840
been them.

02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:18.840
So they, they do work.

02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:22.840
And this is one of those cases where I want to, I want to give

02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:25.840
mad props to the onsite workers.

02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:30.840
Like all the guys that I've had the pleasure of interacting with

02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:32.840
have been just solid.

02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:34.840
And they seem to care.

02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:35.840
They seem to try.

02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:39.840
But I think they really, you know, this is my own speculation.

02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:43.840
I think they really struggle with communication.

02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:47.840
And so when they do make mistakes, a lot of the time it's

02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:50.840
because they just didn't know.

02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:59.840
So this company has screwed up or just not shown up so many

02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:00.840
things.

02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:04.840
And some of it's just like, you know, oh, that could have

02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:07.840
easily been a misunderstanding.

02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:13.840
Like for example, the, all the tiles that this could have been

02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:14.840
a communication issue.

02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:16.840
I don't know, but they were all supposed to go one way.

02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:19.840
And instead it goes one way down the sides and it goes this way

02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:21.840
down the, so it looks stupid.

02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:25.840
They used a different color of grout for like the sandy grout

02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:28.840
around the pool and the ones on the deck.

02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:31.840
And it's like, these are obviously like first world problems.

02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:36.840
But they, oh my God.

02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:37.840
Oh, oh yeah.

02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:40.840
This was, this was, this was a, this was a really good one.

02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:44.840
Our interior contractor, who's a totally different contractor.

02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:45.840
We're really happy with those guys.

02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:46.840
Might as well shut them out too.

02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:51.840
Shermar showed up and was like, Hey, I couldn't help noticing

02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:54.840
they were digging really close to the house and they've done

02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:59.840
nothing to support these, these footings for the upper balcony.

02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:03.840
Yeah, that can't be like that.

02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:06.840
And they, you know, had to help us get that fixed.

02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:09.840
Basically like put these braces on it.

02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:13.840
The, the really, the really bad part, the worst part has been

02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:14.840
the communication though.

02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:17.840
Just yeah, we're coming this day and then they just don't show

02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:19.840
up and then we go, Hey, where the heck are you?

02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:22.840
And like, we're coming this other day.

02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:24.840
Yeah, but that didn't answer my question.

02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:25.840
Where were you?

02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:28.840
And looking at Google reviews, it looks like this has,

02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:32.840
this has become, if it wasn't always a problem.

02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:36.840
And the way that they are conducting their business seems to me

02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:43.840
to be extremely, extremely skeezy where they, you know,

02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:45.840
they, they say they're going to do things.

02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:46.840
They don't do things.

02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:50.840
They say they're, they're taking deposits to acquire materials.

02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:53.840
Those materials take an extremely long time to show up.

02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:56.840
You just, and it's, it's just endless.

02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:01.840
You know, we, you know how we're neighbors with cover star?

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:03.840
Yeah.

02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:06.840
So when we were talking about pool covers, we were like,

02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:08.840
Oh, hey, we're neighbors with cover star.

02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:11.840
Why don't we go swing by and ask them if they want to do a neighborly

02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:13.840
discount or if there's anything that we can, we can do with them.

02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:16.840
Cause we're like literally almost next door neighbors.

02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:17.840
You never know, right?

02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:20.840
Like it never hurts to ask if you ask for the friends and neighbors

02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:24.840
discount as one of the local paint chains, they will literally

02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:27.840
just apply a discount to your order.

02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:29.840
Um, maybe it never hurts to ask.

02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:32.840
And they're like, Oh yeah, well, we used to use cover star a lot,

02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:33.840
but these other ones are better.

02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:37.840
And then all these like 18 months later or whatever, they're like,

02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:39.840
Hey, yeah, we're getting the sizing done.

02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:40.840
Cover star is coming up to measure it.

02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:42.840
And I'm like, which is fine.

02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:45.840
I had no problem using cover star, but you could have just told me

02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:48.840
that and then I could have asked them if we can get a friends and

02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:49.840
neighbors discount.

02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:50.840
Yeah.

02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:55.840
Um, and like, you know, in, in a very early version of the statement

02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:58.840
of work, it's very clear that we wanted in wall stairs.

02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:00.840
Uh, cause I really like in wall stairs.

02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:04.840
I don't like the ladder hanging in like harder to clean pain in the butt.

02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:07.840
Um, and like it feels way more stable.

02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:09.840
Yeah, I just, I just wanted in wall stairs.

02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:14.840
And so, you know, they sent us a bill for, first of all, we noticed

02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:16.840
they weren't there and then we're like, Hey, they're not there.

02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:19.840
And they sent us a bill for what it would cost to add in wall stairs.

02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:21.840
And we send them the thing that's like, Hey, this says in wall stairs.

02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:24.840
And it's been a year and a half.

02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:27.840
So there was some verbal communication in addition to it just being

02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:28.840
written on the thing.

02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:32.840
And so it's not actually legally binding that they were definitely

02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:33.840
doing it.

02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:36.840
But then there's one other Google review where the person also says

02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:39.840
they asked for in wall stairs and then we're billed for it later.

02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:42.840
Um, so maybe this is just a play.

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:43.840
I don't know.

02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:47.840
Um, but long story short.

02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:53.840
The challenges are and you're probably asking like you think you guys

02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:56.840
would have learned, you know, why do you keep working with them?

02:29:56.840 --> 02:30:01.840
And there's not a lot of pool contractors in the Vancouver area.

02:30:01.840 --> 02:30:04.840
And particularly for concrete pools, there are even fewer.

02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:06.840
So you're, you're sort of at the mercy.

02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:10.840
They, they take deposits, which, um, you know, yeah, you're right.

02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:13.840
Maybe we should have stopped giving them deposits, but we always kept

02:30:13.840 --> 02:30:16.840
being told, yeah, no, we're going to, we're going to, you know, we're

02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:18.840
going to get it, you know, we're going to get it done soon.

02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:19.840
We're so close. We're so close.

02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:22.840
We're so close. We are actually extremely close right now.

02:30:22.840 --> 02:30:25.840
All they have to do, the slabs already outside.

02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:31.840
All they have to do is put the pool equipment on the slab and cut

02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:34.840
in the stupid in wall stairs that I asked for.

02:30:34.840 --> 02:30:41.840
Um, and do the, uh, install the cover and then put on the,

02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:44.840
whatever the material they put over the concrete on the,

02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:46.840
on the inside of the pool is forget what it's called.

02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:49.840
It's like some plaster or something, something like that.

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:52.840
Uh, and it's like a couple of weeks of work and we've been sitting

02:30:52.840 --> 02:30:54.840
here with a couple of weeks of work left on the project since

02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:56.840
like March or something like that.

02:30:56.840 --> 02:30:59.840
Uh, and it's, it's like constantly like this with these guys,

02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:02.840
they finally acknowledged now. So this is, I guess an improvement

02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:04.840
since we gave them an ultimatum where we're like, Hey,

02:31:04.840 --> 02:31:07.840
you guys need to show up and start working continuously starting

02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:09.840
on this day or we're going public with this.

02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:11.840
Like it's not the kind of thing we like to do, but I,

02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:15.840
this is ridiculous and you, you basically, um,

02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:20.840
yeah, yeah, you earned it. Um,

02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:23.840
so they finally admitted to us that, yes,

02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:26.840
they're pulling people off our job and putting them on other jobs.

02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:30.840
And we're sitting here going, no, um,

02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:34.840
our project has been pending for two years and the second

02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:38.840
summer it's going to miss and the delays have been from you guys,

02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:40.840
not from us. These were not our fault.

02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:44.840
We've always, we've always paid promptly as promptly as we can,

02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:47.840
given that Yvonne finds all kinds of billing irregularities,

02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:51.840
excuse Yvonne. Um, and so it takes a ton of time.

02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:55.840
It has, it has taken an inordinate amount of time for her because

02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:57.840
there'd be no communication from HQ.

02:31:57.840 --> 02:32:00.840
So she would have to go out every morning and tell that she basically

02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:02.840
had to project manage it when they were doing the landscaping

02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:04.840
because nobody told anybody anything.

02:32:04.840 --> 02:32:06.840
So they ended up doing all kinds of dumb stuff,

02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:11.840
like digging up a trench in the wrongs or like they dug up this

02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:15.840
drain thing that they ultimately had then covered and then had to like dig

02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:18.840
again, retrench it and then put a new one in because it just like,

02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:21.840
didn't have a drain anymore, um, allegedly.

02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:23.840
Yeah.

02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:27.840
So I'm, I'm extremely frustrated and that's why we haven't been

02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:31.840
able to do whole room water cooling for the server room because,

02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:33.840
um, even though.

02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:38.840
Sure, Mars plumbing guys did a great job of putting in all the,

02:32:38.840 --> 02:32:40.840
all the piping and everything that we needed before the concrete did

02:32:40.840 --> 02:32:43.840
finally, or the shock treat did ultimately get put in.

02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:49.840
Um, there's nothing to, there's no pool to act as a thermal mess.

02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:53.840
So, you know, again, I want to be very clear.

02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:55.840
This is a first world problem.

02:32:55.840 --> 02:32:59.840
I get it, but also when you pay for something, you should probably,

02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:01.840
and you shake hands and you have an agreement,

02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:03.840
then you should probably get that thing.

02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:07.840
Is it, is there like special liabilities with making pools or something?

02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:10.840
Like, is there some reason why you couldn't get a general contractor?

02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:13.840
Yeah, it's just, it's a really specialized type of work.

02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:17.840
And, uh, we did find another pool contractor that's willing to take

02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:21.840
over the job, which is part of why I'm able to talk about this because

02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:23.840
like I was like at their mercy.

02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:26.840
Basically they had my money and unless I want to take them to court,

02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:29.840
which I don't think I'm the only person doing at this point.

02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:36.840
Um, either I play ball and get a pool or I antagonize them and they

02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:38.840
just pull everybody off my job and work on something else.

02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:40.840
Cause they clearly have other work to do.

02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:43.840
Right. So I'm just sort of sitting here stuck.

02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:46.840
Um, sorry, what was your question again though?

02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:48.840
Uh, no, I just, I don't know.

02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:52.840
Yeah, we found another one that's willing to finish the job.

02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:58.840
So that's great, but the referral we got for these guys was from

02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:01.840
like another mom at the school and she was like, yeah,

02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:04.840
it took six months and it was pulling teeth, but they did get it done.

02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:10.840
So it's not a perfect reference and they won't even look at it,

02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:15.840
let alone quote it until we have formally dismissed Jiren from the job.

02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:19.840
Oh, which is, you know, going back to luring you into the

02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:22.840
Computex to get you to cover something different.

02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:24.840
Yeah. A classic contractor move.

02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:25.840
Yeah, that's brutal.

02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:29.840
Um, cause yeah, if their quote sucks, then, you know,

02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:33.840
obviously I don't want to go with them.

02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:36.840
Would you consider if they charged you to come out and quote it?

02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:38.840
Um, better.

02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:39.840
They charge you like an hourly.

02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:41.840
No, no, no, but I'm saying like, sure.

02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:45.840
Yeah, cause I could, I could understand like them being like, yeah,

02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:50.840
I don't want to just help you like negotiate a better rate for somebody else.

02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:51.840
Yeah.

02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:55.840
Rough.

02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:56.840
Yeah.

02:34:56.840 --> 02:35:00.840
At least I now know that there won't be swimming at Linus's place this summer.

02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:02.840
Yeah, I've given up.

02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:05.840
We were supposed to be swimming before the end of last summer.

02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:06.840
Yeah.

02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:08.840
And I don't think we're going to swim in 2023.

02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:09.840
Yeah.

02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:11.840
If you're searching contractors and stuff like that.

02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:12.840
Yeah.

02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:13.840
I really don't see it happening.

02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:15.840
There isn't that much to do.

02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:17.840
There's like two weeks of work left to do Luke.

02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:20.840
Theoretically, I should be swimming in mid June.

02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:21.840
I wouldn't be surprised though,

02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:23.840
because if this new contractor comes in,

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:26.840
they might have liability concerns about the previously existing.

02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:28.840
We're going to have to go and check a whole bunch of stuff,

02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:30.840
which I'm sure I'm going to pay for.

02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:31.840
Yep.

02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:33.840
I'm really frustrated.

02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:35.840
Yeah, I think it's going to be rough.

02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:36.840
Okay.

02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:37.840
Are there other topics?

02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:39.840
LTX 2023 update.

02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:42.840
We are under two months away from LTX 2023.

02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:45.840
We have sold over 3,500 tickets so far.

02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:48.840
There are an insane amount of creators.

02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:51.840
Actually just naming them all would take a significant period of time.

02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:56.840
So I would suggest going to LTXExpo.com slash creators and checking out yourself.

02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:00.840
Also volunteer applications are live.

02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:01.840
Okay, there it is.

02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:03.840
It's not a link for some reason,

02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:07.840
but you can sign up to volunteer by visiting LTXExpo.com slash volunteer.

02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:11.840
Applicants will receive confirmation starting Monday.

02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:13.840
Some things that you can do at LTX.

02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:19.840
There's a PC building workshop sponsored by ASUS where you can learn to build a PC from start to finish.

02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:25.840
Great for those wanting to know where to start or potentially a fun way to like show a partner or a friend how to do it.

02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:29.840
There are 20 different stations with workshops happening all throughout the event.

02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:32.840
There's a space cadet pinball sponsored by Height.

02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:37.840
Eight different stations of space cadet pinball on custom LTX rigs.

02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:40.840
And there's a high score leaderboard with prizes for the highest scores.

02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:44.840
There's racing sims sponsored by Black Point Cyber.

02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:47.840
Seven awesome racing sims with D-Box haptic systems.

02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:51.840
Integrated leaderboard with best laps of the day as well.

02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:53.840
There are VR RC cars.

02:36:53.840 --> 02:37:00.840
Again, take control with our modified cars equipped with an FPV system and steering wheel slash pedal controls.

02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:02.840
Is this the same setup as last time?

02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:03.840
But way better.

02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:04.840
Nice.

02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:05.840
Yeah, it's...

02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:06.840
No.

02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:07.840
Okay.

02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:08.840
It's all new.

02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:09.840
Okay.

02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:10.840
Way better.

02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:12.840
There's a custom race course on the expo floor.

02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:15.840
When he says that last time it was sick.

02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:18.840
It was sick, but it was unreliable.

02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:20.840
We couldn't keep the cars in operation.

02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:21.840
Oh, it makes sense.

02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:24.840
So it's designed to be a lot more reliable this time.

02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:25.840
Cool.

02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:27.840
And there's a 1v1 pyramid.

02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:28.840
What?

02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:32.840
Win your way to the top of the variety of classic and modern games.

02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:33.840
Oh, cool.

02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:35.840
So there's like a little 1v1 tournament.

02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:36.840
All right.

02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:39.840
Best slash worst of SC short circuit.

02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:40.840
Love it or hate it.

02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:45.840
Our short circuit hosts have picked the best and worst products seen on the channel to look at and experience.

02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:47.840
DIY Ethernet cable.

02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:50.840
Learn how to crimp and make your own CAT 6A Ethernet cable.

02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:55.840
Take it a step further and see if you have what it takes to build a cable as fast as possible.

02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:57.840
Whale land sponsored by Ubiquity.

02:37:57.840 --> 02:37:59.840
Two full days of land games and tournaments.

02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:02.840
And water cooling workshops with Epic Games.

02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:03.840
Oh, cool.

02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:07.840
Learn the ins and outs of water cooling from AIOs to custom hard line loops.

02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:13.840
There's also PC building simulator 2 will be featured at the booth if you want to create a virtual loop instead.

02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:18.840
Get your tickets today at tickets.ltxxpo.com.

02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:20.840
I am pretty hyped.

02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:22.840
I'm really excited.

02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:27.840
That was a very consistent topic of conversation throughout Confitex talking to other creators.

02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:29.840
So I'm like, yeah, I'll see you at LTX man.

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:31.840
Man, there's so many creators.

02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:32.840
Tech tech potatoes coming.

02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:38.840
So that's Dr. Ian Cutress, Toasty Bros, UFD Tech, Stacey Roy.

02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:40.840
Taren's apparently coming.

02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:42.840
Taren Van Hemer is on the list.

02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:43.840
That's funny.

02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:46.840
I didn't negotiate all of these necessarily.

02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:48.840
So some of these I'm finding out for the first time.

02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:49.840
Snazzy Labs is coming though.

02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:50.840
Sort of the home's coming.

02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:55.840
Sarah Ditchie, Christopher Yee, Pedro from PCMR is coming.

02:38:55.840 --> 02:38:59.840
Paul's Hardware, Eposvox, Electro Boom is going to drop by.

02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:06.840
David Mell from Marquez's team, Craft Computing, Coalition Gaming, Chris Titus Tech.

02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:09.840
This is just, Brandon Wiley is coming too.

02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:10.840
Oh, that's awesome.

02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:11.840
That makes sense.

02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:12.840
Ant Venom's coming.

02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:15.840
Man, there are so devours coming.

02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:16.840
Hardware Connects.

02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:18.840
Eva from Hardware Connects is coming.

02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:20.840
Greg Salazar, Jays2Cents.

02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:22.840
Actually too many to name them all.

02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:25.840
So again, I would suggest checking out the creators page.

02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:27.840
Because it's actually going to be nuts.

02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:29.840
Yeah, Strange Parts.

02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:31.840
This is awesome.

02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:33.840
Hey!

02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:35.840
Oh crap, I'm an idiot.

02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:38.840
I always forget if his name is Corey or Carrie.

02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:46.840
The Fox, who really specializes in handhelds and has been just killing it lately.

02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:47.840
Killing it.

02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:50.840
Like, look at this view to subscriber ratio.

02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:51.840
Wow.

02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:55.840
76,000 subscribers, but regularly doing 20 to 80,000 views a video.

02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:58.840
Getting more views than your subscriber count is pretty sick.

02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:01.840
That always means you did a banger.

02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:02.840
Yeah.

02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:04.840
You did a banger.

02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:05.840
Theo Joe.

02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:08.840
Theo Joe making an appearance.

02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:09.840
Love it.

02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:10.840
Okay.

02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:13.840
What are we supposed to do now, Dan?

02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:17.840
I'm lost without our cue cards.

02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:20.840
Yeah, I forgot to mail them to you.

02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:21.840
Well, let's see.

02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:25.840
We technically have another 10 minutes until WAN after dark.

02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:28.840
But we do have a hell of a lot of merge messages.

02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:31.840
So WAN in the morning.

02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:32.840
Really?

02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:34.840
I'm surprised there's that many merge messages.

02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:37.840
There's a lot of really good questions today.

02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:38.840
Oh.

02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:42.840
There's not.

02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:46.840
Way to go, Luke.

02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:47.840
Wow.

02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:52.840
I mean, it's been a lot worse.

02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:54.840
You're basically an abuser.

02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:55.840
Oh my goodness.

02:40:55.840 --> 02:40:57.840
Oh my gosh.

02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:01.840
Luke, the doc wasn't done when we were looking at this.

02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:06.840
There's like huge stuff in here that we haven't talked about yet.

02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:11.840
Thanks, Riley, adding all this stuff that we absolutely have to talk about.

02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:12.840
Okay.

02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:13.840
Where are we at?

02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:20.840
Diablo 4 developers do a Q&A with fake slash softball fan questions.

02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:22.840
This is extremely not surprising.

02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:23.840
This is amazing.

02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:24.840
Yeah.

02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:25.840
Okay.

02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:29.840
Games Radars Future Games show interviewed the art director and associate game director

02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:35.840
of Diablo 4 asking fan questions like the cut scenes in D4 are gorgeous.

02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:40.840
How important was it to get these as high quality as they are in the game?

02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:46.840
Twitter user Phil Tackler looked up the social handles of the fans who submitted the questions

02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:51.840
and they were a mixture of inactive accounts made years ago or extremely recently.

02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:52.840
Okay.

02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:57.840
To be fair, that might be fine.

02:41:57.840 --> 02:41:58.840
Yeah.

02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:00.840
It might be people that just have to throw away Twitter accounts.

02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:01.840
Yeah.

02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:03.840
But also it wouldn't have been all of them.

02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:04.840
For sure.

02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:05.840
Yeah.

02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:09.840
When asked for comment, Blizzard said they were not involved in the process of gathering

02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:10.840
questions.

02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:15.840
After much discourse, the future game show posted an update via a comment on the original

02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:19.840
interview saying we messed up in quotes.

02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:23.840
Basically they claim many of the questions were legit, but the social handles were randomly

02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:26.840
generated to protect the original.

02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:30.840
Randomly generated, but they've landed on actual handles.

02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:31.840
Cool.

02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:32.840
What?

02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:36.840
I'm sure that's against at least someone's terms of service.

02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:40.840
That's weird.

02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:42.840
Okay.

02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:43.840
Moving on.

02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:46.840
We got to talk about this one because it was actually called out at the beginning.

02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:48.840
Dolphin Steam Launch postponed.

02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:53.840
The Dolphin emulator team has announced that its planned steam release has been indefinitely

02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:59.840
postponed, following a letter written from Nintendo to Valve, citing the digital millennium

02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:03.840
copyright actor, DMCA, which is kind of rough.

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:04.840
Making matters worse.

02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:09.840
Valve confirmed that they reached out to Nintendo first, presumably because they knew

02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:13.840
that as a platform hosting Dolphin, Valve would be, that makes matters worse.

02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:15.840
That's just not surprising at all.

02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:17.840
Valve would be in the crosshairs of Nintendo's lawyers.

02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:18.840
Obviously.

02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:19.840
Yeah.

02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:20.840
Makes sense that they would have done that.

02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:25.840
As Dolphin had not been released on Steam, the letter is more of a shot across the

02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:30.840
Valve, warning Valve that the emulators release would violate the DMCA.

02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:33.840
Would it though?

02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:34.840
Okay.

02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:35.840
Well here, sure.

02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:37.840
This is, I guess, the argument.

02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:41.840
Dolphin's code contains the Wii common key.

02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:42.840
Yeah.

02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:47.840
That sounds like a Nintendo's proprietary code for decrypting Wii games, which is a 39

02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:49.840
digit number that is well known.

02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:53.840
Don't paste it here, says our writer.

02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:57.840
But having that in the thing, like that does actually make sense to something that you

02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.840
could go after, even if it is commonly known or whatever.

02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:06.840
Some other emulators require the game files to host such keys instead, which is arguably

02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:09.840
legally safer.

02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:11.840
Not that we know anything allegedly.

02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:14.840
This is not legal advice, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:16.840
Yeah, exactly.

02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:21.840
A spokesperson for Nintendo said, using illegal emulators or illegal copies of games harms

02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:24.840
development and ultimately stifles innovation.

02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:26.840
Discussion question.

02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:31.840
Nintendo being, asshole is one thing, but is there anything else Valve could have done

02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:32.840
other than poke the bear?

02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:33.840
I don't think so.

02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:37.840
No, I mean, they were going to be, Valve is no strength.

02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:39.840
You know, at their scale, it just happened.

02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:41.840
I mean, we talked about this recently.

02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:42.840
What was it?

02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:47.840
The Rumble on the Steam Deck or something like that has some pat and troll coming after

02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:48.840
them right now.

02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:49.840
Yeah.

02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:54.840
As much as I have pointed at Valve in the past and been non-happy, this was very reasonable

02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:55.840
for them to do.

02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:56.840
Yeah.

02:44:56.840 --> 02:44:57.840
Yeah.

02:44:57.840 --> 02:44:58.840
Yeah.

02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:05.840
As much as I have pointed at Valve in the past and been non-happy, this was very reasonable

02:45:05.840 --> 02:45:07.840
for them to do.

02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:08.840
Yeah.

02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:14.840
As for whether using emulators, which by the way are not illegal Nintendo, as for whether

02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:20.840
that ultimately stifles innovation, I would say that playing Tears of the Kingdom at 4K

02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:30.840
60 FPS with improved visual fidelity is innovation and your crappy hardware stifles innovation.

02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:31.840
Boom.

02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:32.840
This can go both ways.

02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:33.840
Boom.

02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:34.840
Got them.

02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:35.840
Yeah.

02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:36.840
Got them.

02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:43.840
Speaking of stifling innovation, did you see the Reddit API pricing conversation?

02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:44.840
Yes.

02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:46.840
By the way, can I help you with this?

02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:47.840
What the hell, man?

02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:49.840
Do you not even do this, bro?

02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:51.840
Oh, I actually like the separation.

02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:52.840
Oh.

02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:53.840
It helps my brain.

02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:54.840
All right.

02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:55.840
Well, I'm sorry.

02:45:55.840 --> 02:45:56.840
I broke your pain, though.

02:45:56.840 --> 02:45:57.840
It's fine.

02:45:57.840 --> 02:45:58.840
Not the first time.

02:45:58.840 --> 02:45:59.840
Yeah.

02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:06.240
Christian Selig, the developer of the popular Apollo iOS app for Reddit, says that Reddit

02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:11.840
wants $12,000 per 50 million requests.

02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:13.840
And this is a quote here.

02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:20.840
Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at about $1.7 million a

02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:21.840
month.

02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:28.840
The average Apollo user uses 344 requests per day, which would cost $2.50 a month.

02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:34.840
That means even with only subscription users, the app would be unable to break even.

02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:40.840
Imgur apparently charges Apollo $166 for the same number of requests.

02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:45.840
That is literally almost an order of, no.

02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:46.840
Oh, wow.

02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:49.840
Almost two orders of magnitude less.

02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:55.840
Twitter, of course, kicked off the trend of expensive API access to social platforms with

02:46:55.840 --> 02:47:01.840
its lowest tier offering only 10,000 requests for $100.

02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:06.160
Twitter has subsequently been abandoned as a data source by many academics, and the future

02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:12.880
of many long-term projects is unclear, such as Bottle, which assesses how likely an account

02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:22.160
is to be a bot, and whose work was actually cited in Elon Musk's fight to not buy Twitter.

02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:27.480
Yeah, this sucks.

02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:29.880
People are asking who would pay that for Reddit's API, though.

02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:30.880
I think that's the point.

02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:31.880
I think that's the point.

02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:38.880
The point is that these platforms are getting scraped by AI companies and not getting any

02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:44.600
of the money that is getting dumped into AI right now, and they're sitting there going,

02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:53.080
well, if we kill a bunch of research projects and we kill a bunch of community favorite

02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:59.240
third-party apps in the process, I guess that's totally worth it because we'll definitely

02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:04.120
still be popular platforms that will definitely still be valuable for these AI companies to

02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:07.240
scrape and we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:16.240
Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen in that regard, but it's not surprising at

02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:19.160
all to me.

02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:20.160
It sucks.

02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:21.160
Yeah.

02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:24.800
There's a fair bit more information that I've been reading about this that's not in our

02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:32.760
notes here necessarily, but Christian, the Apollo developer, sort of broke down from

02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:43.120
Reddit's public financial statements how much each of those calls has to cost them.

02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:50.920
They're so far beyond just, well, the Reddit app has ads that help support us and we're

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:56.200
not getting that from your third-party app and we need to find a way to make this sustainable.

02:48:56.200 --> 02:48:59.400
They're so far beyond just, we need to be sustainable.

02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:03.120
This is just a blatant cash grab, according to his math.

02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:07.560
Someone in the full-claim chat said the Google Maps API is less than $900 for 500,000 calls

02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:08.560
for comparison.

02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:11.600
Yeah, I said this with the Twitter one too.

02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:16.040
The goal here is not to make it affordable or to make it make sense.

02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:22.480
The goal here is to crush third-party apps.

02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:30.280
Given how unpopular the first-party Reddit app is, I've got to wonder what this means

02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:33.560
for Reddit.

02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:35.320
No one's safe.

02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:36.320
Where's Slash.today?

02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:37.320
Where's Dig?

02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:42.680
I do agree with that, but I feel like we've been in an actually surprisingly long period

02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:44.560
of internet stagnation now.

02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:48.440
But it's like that article I sent you before, the inshidification of everything.

02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:54.320
I think the reason that everything is coming to a head right now is because we also went

02:49:54.320 --> 02:50:06.000
through a period of basically unrestricted money hose flowing into technology, into web,

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:09.400
however many point-o companies.

02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:16.480
So now that that spigot is getting turned off and it's all going into AI or it's going

02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:24.320
into finding new ways to make housing unaffordable for regular people, I think we're seeing these

02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:31.720
companies pivot to, hey, we just need to make money to please our shareholders.

02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:33.800
We can't just be in this growth phase.

02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:37.440
We can't be in a pleasing the user phase anymore.

02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:41.760
Because I know some people are going to sniff at that and be like, oh yeah, but no companies

02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:43.440
are going to pay this API fee.

02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:44.440
That might be true.

02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:47.840
I don't think they're necessarily expecting to make money off of this.

02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:55.040
But I do think a significant effort is being put to hamper how much other people are able

02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:56.880
to make money off of your stuff.

02:50:56.880 --> 02:50:59.880
Yeah, just putting up walls.

02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:05.120
If someone is using Twitter, we want them using Twitter through our own means.

02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:09.440
If someone is using Reddit, we want them using Reddit through our own means, et cetera.

02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:10.440
Yeah.

02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:11.440
Yeah.

02:51:11.440 --> 02:51:15.680
Someone in the full-plane chat, run John said, my Reddit account is 15 years old.

02:51:15.680 --> 02:51:18.280
I'll be leaving once they kill third-party apps.

02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:20.840
To be completely honest, that'll probably be good for you anyways.

02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:27.000
Hey, iOS says the first-party Reddit app makes thousands of tracking calls to the web that

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:31.280
my piehole went nuts blocking and blew the log files up to gigabytes.

02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:34.640
So yeah, there are reasons.

02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:40.760
There are reasons they want you using the first-party tools and they're not always user-friendly

02:51:40.760 --> 02:51:41.760
reasons.

02:51:41.760 --> 02:51:42.760
Oh, yeah.

02:51:42.760 --> 02:51:43.920
They really are.

02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:44.920
Just stop using it.

02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:47.480
Is your life actually enriched by using Reddit?

02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:49.200
Maybe, but probably not as much as you think it is.

02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:50.200
Can be.

02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:53.400
Reddit's a really good resource for like, how do I fix this problem, Reddit?

02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:57.600
I don't know if I'm just being cynical here, maybe I am or pessimistic or whatever, but

02:51:57.600 --> 02:52:04.720
I think most people do scroll instead of gather information in that way.

02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:10.440
I have found that a more effective Google search for a while has been the same Google

02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:14.080
search that you would normally do and then you append Reddit on the end.

02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:15.080
That's kind of unfortunate.

02:52:15.080 --> 02:52:21.840
It just shows Google going down the hole, to be honest, but if you use it in that way,

02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:22.840
that's kind of its own thing.

02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:26.920
And if you use it in that way, you don't really need the app either, if we're being

02:52:27.920 --> 02:52:28.920
honest.

02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:29.920
Oh, I don't use the app.

02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:30.920
Yeah.

02:52:30.920 --> 02:52:37.280
I actually have just like a muscle memory, there's no way to get rid of the notification

02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:41.840
as far as I can tell on mobile when I'm just on the web, because I can't find, for what

02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:49.160
I do on Reddit, I can't find any reason to use an app instead of just using my browser.

02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:50.760
I can't think of one.

02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:57.680
All I want to do is read things from time to time and post even more occasionally.

02:52:57.680 --> 02:53:01.920
And so it prompts me, like every time I load the site, but it's better in the app.

02:53:01.920 --> 02:53:03.920
You want to use the app?

02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:04.920
No?

02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:05.920
Not really.

02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:09.240
I don't even, I don't, it bothered me for a long time and it definitely hasn't gone

02:53:09.240 --> 02:53:15.920
away, but it doesn't bother me anymore because I just, no, no, no, I think I'm good actually.

02:53:15.920 --> 02:53:22.960
Yeah, someone in full plain chat, my husband absolutely doom scrolls.

02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:25.440
He doesn't learn anything useful 99% of the time.

02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:26.440
Yeah.

02:53:26.440 --> 02:53:30.880
I think that is the standard approach to using Reddit to be completely honest.

02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:36.280
Like I think most people that use Reddit could benefit very significantly from using

02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:39.480
it way less.

02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:41.400
But that isn't saying that Reddit is useless.

02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:44.440
I find it very, very useful for like information.

02:53:44.440 --> 02:53:45.440
Yeah.

02:53:45.640 --> 02:53:49.800
A lot of times when I do that Google search and I append Reddit, Reddit is like actually

02:53:49.800 --> 02:53:54.200
the best source and I do it because I have done it without Reddit at the end and found

02:53:54.200 --> 02:53:58.360
nothing useful and then done it with Reddit at the end and then finding very good answers

02:53:58.360 --> 02:53:59.360
from.

02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:11.120
Guys, I don't know if you can hear me.

02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:16.360
I can't hear you at the moment.

02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:18.360
Hello.

02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:21.360
Oh man.

02:54:21.360 --> 02:54:23.920
Sorry, chat.

02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:26.560
Hold on a second.

02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:30.560
Tap, tap, tap.

02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:49.560
I don't want to adlib everything.

02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:51.560
Not Mike Angie.

02:54:57.560 --> 02:55:02.560
Well, I guess it's just, it's just me now.

02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:14.560
Am I, I'm not sure I'm sending to them either.

02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:16.560
It's very strange.

02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:19.560
I'm mute.

02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:41.560
I'm going to go ahead and restart this browser tab.

02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:48.560
I hope you enjoy seeing the thing that I put up and join.

02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:49.560
Hello.

02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:50.560
Are you there?

02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:51.560
Hello.

02:55:51.560 --> 02:55:52.560
Hi, Dan.

02:55:52.560 --> 02:55:53.560
Hello.

02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:54.560
Oh, he disconnected.

02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:55.560
Oh.

02:55:55.560 --> 02:55:59.560
I did notice there was only one person in call, but I thought it maybe didn't show yourself.

02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:01.560
I was showing that I was still connected.

02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:05.560
I could still see your camera feed because your camera feed is fed directly from your

02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:07.560
call, but I think we lost audio.

02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:08.560
Okay.

02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:09.560
Cool.

02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:10.560
We're back.

02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:11.560
Not my fault.

02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:12.560
Goodbye.

02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:16.560
Well, it's not my fault.

02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:17.560
I think it might be.

02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:18.560
Must be Luke's fault.

02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:19.560
Maybe.

02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:21.560
My proxy is Luke's fault.

02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:22.560
Yeah.

02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:23.560
Oh, that's true.

02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:25.560
I mean, poo rolls down a hill.

02:56:25.560 --> 02:56:29.560
So, up a hill, poo rolls up a hill.

02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:33.560
That management is to blame when someone does something wrong.

02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:35.560
Does that mean poo rolls up a hill?

02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:37.560
I'm not anymore.

02:56:37.560 --> 02:56:39.560
Or wait, it's not July 1st yet.

02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:40.560
Oh, okay.

02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:41.560
Yeah, it's my fault.

02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:43.560
Yeah, it's Linus' fault.

02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:45.560
He got him.

02:56:45.560 --> 02:56:49.560
I want to give you guys a little update on the eating disorder helpline chat bot that

02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:51.560
we talked about previously.

02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:55.560
We have paused their plan to switch from human staff and volunteers to a chat

02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:56.560
bot.

02:56:56.560 --> 02:56:57.560
That's probably good.

02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:00.560
After users found that it was easy to prompt the bot into recommending

02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:04.560
calorie restriction, food avoidance, and frequent weigh-ins.

02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:07.560
Even after the user said the doctor advised them against dieting due to

02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:10.560
their eating disorder.

02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:13.560
I mean, the weight loss advice was broadly accurate, but the bot lacked the

02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:16.560
ability of a human to guide the conversation and simply reflected

02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:20.560
users' preoccupations back at them, potentially reinforcing anorexia

02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:25.560
and bulimia.

02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:29.560
When posts about this issue drew attention online, Nita's communications

02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:33.560
and marketing vice president commented on at least one post calling it a flat

02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:36.560
out lie, but then the next day the chat bot was taken down.

02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:39.560
They described the issue as a bug, thanking the community members who

02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:41.560
brought this to their attention.

02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:43.560
That's a bit of a pivot.

02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:44.560
That's a flat out lie.

02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:46.560
Thank you for bringing it to our attention.

02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:50.560
I know that this wasn't an AI chat bot.

02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:56.560
It's not really on topic in terms of the AI revolution that we're

02:57:56.560 --> 02:57:59.560
undergoing right now, or bubble, or whatever.

02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:00.560
Technology.

02:58:00.560 --> 02:58:07.560
However, it does raise some interesting questions about what it's

02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:13.560
going to look like when someone, inevitably, does do this with an

02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:15.560
AI chat bot.

02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:17.560
I'm glad we talked about it.

02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:19.560
I'm glad we have an update for you guys.

02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:22.560
I'm glad that we can move on to talk about the MetaQuest 3.

02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:24.560
Coming this fall, 4.99.

02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:26.560
Have you seen pictures?

02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:28.560
Just in this dock, actually.

02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:35.560
It is 40% slimmer with full-color pass-through, higher resolution,

02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:41.560
better controllers, and the Quest 2 is getting a price drop to 2.99

02:58:41.560 --> 02:58:44.560
for 128 gigs on June 4.

02:58:44.560 --> 02:58:45.560
That's right.

02:58:45.560 --> 02:58:50.560
A price drop from, so wait, is it?

02:58:50.560 --> 02:58:52.560
Tell me something.

02:58:52.560 --> 02:58:53.560
Okay, hold on.

02:58:53.560 --> 02:58:57.560
Let's just play a little game.

02:58:57.560 --> 02:58:58.560
Drop.

02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:00.560
Okay, what about this?

02:59:00.560 --> 02:59:02.560
Oh.

02:59:02.560 --> 02:59:03.560
Fake?

02:59:03.560 --> 02:59:05.560
What about this?

02:59:05.560 --> 02:59:06.560
Is that?

02:59:06.560 --> 02:59:07.560
Toss.

02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:08.560
Is that a drop?

02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:09.560
A price toss?

02:59:09.560 --> 02:59:12.560
Should we start tolling Amazon sales price tosses?

02:59:12.560 --> 02:59:13.560
Yeah.

02:59:13.560 --> 02:59:14.560
It's extremely loud.

02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:16.560
Oh, sorry.

02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:18.560
Sorry, Dan.

02:59:18.560 --> 02:59:19.560
Sorry, everyone.

02:59:19.560 --> 02:59:20.560
That's okay.

02:59:20.560 --> 02:59:22.560
But it's funny, right?

02:59:22.560 --> 02:59:24.560
Was it at least funny?

02:59:24.560 --> 02:59:25.560
It was pretty good.

02:59:25.560 --> 02:59:26.560
Cool.

02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:28.560
So it's back down to the regular price.

02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:30.560
And just in time for Apple's headset on Monday, let's go.

02:59:30.560 --> 02:59:32.560
That I am much more interested in just saying.

02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:35.560
I've had some interesting debates with people about this.

02:59:35.560 --> 02:59:37.560
I had my first dinner with a billionaire.

02:59:37.560 --> 02:59:41.560
I'm not going to name them, but very, very interesting person.

02:59:41.560 --> 02:59:42.560
I wonder.

02:59:42.560 --> 02:59:45.560
Super smart.

02:59:45.560 --> 02:59:46.560
But you wonder.

02:59:46.560 --> 02:59:47.560
Yeah.

02:59:47.560 --> 02:59:50.560
There's only like a set amount of, was it at Computex?

02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:51.560
Don't worry about it.

02:59:51.560 --> 02:59:52.560
Okay.

02:59:52.560 --> 02:59:55.560
Anyway, the point is super nice, super smart,

02:59:55.560 --> 03:00:00.560
shockingly engaged in like the business for someone who

03:00:00.560 --> 03:00:04.560
realistically doesn't have to do anymore.

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:08.560
And we had a really cool conversation about Apple,

03:00:08.560 --> 03:00:11.560
where they basically were like, yeah, Apple's really great.

03:00:11.560 --> 03:00:14.560
And I was like, yeah, Apple's really great until you like get into

03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:17.560
their sort of hypocrisy and the way they treat their users.

03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:20.560
Like, oh, you want to update the firmware on that product you bought?

03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:22.560
Oh, you haven't bought enough of our products.

03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:25.560
Oh, that's too bad.

03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:28.560
And, you know, go borrow someone else's.

03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:29.560
Yeah.

03:00:29.560 --> 03:00:32.560
Some of their business that they are quite invested in,

03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:34.560
you know, I'm going to keep things very vague so that it's really

03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:36.560
difficult to pin this down.

03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:39.560
But some of their business that they're invested in has,

03:00:39.560 --> 03:00:44.560
it takes a very principled approach to product development

03:00:44.560 --> 03:00:46.560
and to billing for their customers.

03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:48.560
And, you know, I really respect that.

03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:53.560
And so, you know, I felt like I wasn't just talking to someone

03:00:53.560 --> 03:00:56.560
who's like, well, of course Apple should do that.

03:00:56.560 --> 03:00:57.560
They should just make more money.

03:00:57.560 --> 03:00:59.560
Like it was, it was really great conversation.

03:00:59.560 --> 03:01:03.560
And we steered back towards Apple later on in the conversation

03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:09.560
because they sort of asked me to speculate on Apple's VR headset.

03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:13.560
I kind of went, look, I know that this sort of flies in the face of

03:01:13.560 --> 03:01:16.560
everything I just said about Apple because I said a bunch of negative stuff,

03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:19.560
but that doesn't mean that I don't acknowledge the positive that they do.

03:01:19.560 --> 03:01:22.560
And that doesn't mean that I don't respect a lot of what they do

03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:24.560
and their technological innovation and all that.

03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:28.560
And I think if anyone's going to do this, I think it's Apple.

03:01:28.560 --> 03:01:33.560
And I think they're going to follow a really similar playbook

03:01:33.560 --> 03:01:37.560
to the one that I recognized with the Apple Watch.

03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:40.560
And it wasn't the first time they'd done this,

03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:43.560
but it was the first time that I was red-pilled enough

03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:46.560
to figure out what it was that they were doing.

03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:48.560
Do you remember what went down with...

03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:50.560
Red-pilled enough?

03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:52.560
Yeah.

03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:53.560
What?

03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:57.560
Just like, you know, reality aware enough.

03:01:57.560 --> 03:01:58.560
Whoa.

03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:00.560
What?

03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:05.560
I know that it has, like, stupid, like, negative connotations or whatever,

03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:08.560
but I refuse to see it that way.

03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:09.560
You're going with movie reference?

03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:11.560
I'm going with movie reference, the Matrix.

03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:12.560
I respect that, yeah, yeah.

03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:15.560
So...

03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:19.560
So do you remember what they did with the Apple Watch?

03:02:19.560 --> 03:02:22.560
Didn't they just, like, wait,

03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:24.560
observe other people doing it wrong and then do it themselves?

03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:27.560
Well, yeah, they did that to a degree,

03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:31.560
but they released the Apple Watch, right?

03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:33.560
As long as it's not the little blue pills Linus.

03:02:33.560 --> 03:02:35.560
What's wrong with that?

03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:36.560
I mean, you know...

03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:37.560
Things happen, okay?

03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:40.560
You want to please your partner, right?

03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:42.560
You need a little bit of help and nothing wrong with that.

03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:45.560
It's not, life isn't about holding each other down, okay?

03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:49.560
Sometimes it's about lifting things up.

03:02:49.560 --> 03:02:52.560
Anywho, what they did with the Apple Watch

03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:55.560
was they released it as the Apple Watch,

03:02:55.560 --> 03:02:59.560
and then when the next generation product came out,

03:02:59.560 --> 03:03:01.560
all of a sudden it was, like,

03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:03.560
Apple Watch Series 1 or something like that.

03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:07.560
Like, remember the branding was kind of funny around it?

03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:10.560
And what they did is they retroactively,

03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:14.560
like, retconned the Apple Watch being the Apple Watch,

03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:18.560
and they changed the name to Series 0.

03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:22.560
And then, like, really quickly, software support for it,

03:03:22.560 --> 03:03:24.560
like, kind of went...

03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:26.560
Like, it wasn't getting the latest features,

03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:27.560
and it got kind of...

03:03:27.560 --> 03:03:28.560
I knew about that.

03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:29.560
Yeah, it got kind of, like,

03:03:29.560 --> 03:03:32.560
B-tier long-term software support,

03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:36.560
and was sort of treated as...

03:03:36.560 --> 03:03:39.560
was sort of treated as, like, a lesser product.

03:03:39.560 --> 03:03:41.560
It kind of went away.

03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:45.560
And what I figured out at that time was, oh,

03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:50.560
this is the Apple version of a dev kit.

03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:51.560
They just...

03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:53.560
It's, like, minimum viable product.

03:03:53.560 --> 03:03:54.560
It's...

03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:55.560
Yeah, that makes sense.

03:03:55.560 --> 03:03:58.560
It's acceptable enough.

03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:01.560
And, you know, as long as we...

03:04:01.560 --> 03:04:03.560
And the hardware is, like, underpowered.

03:04:03.560 --> 03:04:04.560
It's slow and it's crappy,

03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:06.560
but we're just going to kind of, like,

03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:08.560
support it for as long as we kind of have to.

03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:09.560
And the new ones are so much better

03:04:09.560 --> 03:04:11.560
that most people will probably upgrade anyway,

03:04:11.560 --> 03:04:14.560
and hope they didn't buy the gold one.

03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:17.560
And it just kind of quietly went away.

03:04:17.560 --> 03:04:23.560
And it wasn't until later that I realized that...

03:04:23.560 --> 03:04:25.560
Oh, apparently Series Zero was an unofficial name.

03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:30.560
They just called it Apple Watch First Generation.

03:04:30.560 --> 03:04:32.560
And they released a Series One

03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:33.560
that was an upgraded version of the original.

03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:34.560
Okay, so there.

03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:36.560
That was the funky branding.

03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:38.560
So that's why people called it the Series Zero,

03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:42.560
because the first one just, like, sucked.

03:04:42.560 --> 03:04:44.560
It basically got treated like an experiment.

03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:46.560
And it's not the first time they did that.

03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:51.560
The iPad is actually another classic example.

03:04:51.560 --> 03:04:55.560
The first generation iPad was so much worse

03:04:55.560 --> 03:04:57.560
than the next generation iPad.

03:04:57.560 --> 03:04:59.560
It was way slower.

03:04:59.560 --> 03:05:00.560
It was fatter.

03:05:00.560 --> 03:05:02.560
The battery life sucked.

03:05:02.560 --> 03:05:04.560
It was so much worse

03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:06.560
that I forget what the exact numbers are,

03:05:06.560 --> 03:05:08.560
but I think it ended up getting software support

03:05:08.560 --> 03:05:11.560
for something like half the amount of time

03:05:11.560 --> 03:05:13.560
compared to the iPad 2,

03:05:13.560 --> 03:05:16.560
which was back when Apple had sensible product naming schemes

03:05:16.560 --> 03:05:18.560
for at least some things.

03:05:18.560 --> 03:05:20.560
iPad, iPad 2, simple, right?

03:05:20.560 --> 03:05:21.560
No.

03:05:21.560 --> 03:05:22.560
Anyway.

03:05:22.560 --> 03:05:26.560
And so this is kind of a thing they do.

03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:29.560
The first generation iPhone sucked.

03:05:29.560 --> 03:05:32.560
It didn't even have 3G support, right?

03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:33.560
Like, it sucked.

03:05:33.560 --> 03:05:36.560
It was essentially a dev kit.

03:05:36.560 --> 03:05:40.560
And I think you could make that argument pretty solidly

03:05:40.560 --> 03:05:42.560
for all three of those products.

03:05:42.560 --> 03:05:44.560
Is it right off of that first one very quickly though?

03:05:44.560 --> 03:05:45.560
Exactly.

03:05:45.560 --> 03:05:46.560
Yeah.

03:05:46.560 --> 03:05:47.560
That's what I'm saying.

03:05:47.560 --> 03:05:49.560
So I was looking at this.

03:05:49.560 --> 03:05:52.560
I'm looking at all the...

03:05:52.560 --> 03:05:53.560
Oh, my.

03:05:53.560 --> 03:05:57.560
Yeah, this is not a very good connector.

03:05:57.560 --> 03:06:01.560
So I'm looking at all of the indications

03:06:01.560 --> 03:06:04.560
for the upcoming Apple, Apple VR, Mixed Reality,

03:06:04.560 --> 03:06:05.560
whatever you want to call it,

03:06:05.560 --> 03:06:06.560
the upcoming Apple headset.

03:06:06.560 --> 03:06:08.560
And it's like, yeah, it's probably

03:06:08.560 --> 03:06:10.560
basically not going to do anything out of the gate.

03:06:10.560 --> 03:06:12.560
And this technology is super immature

03:06:12.560 --> 03:06:14.560
and it's probably going to kind of suck.

03:06:14.560 --> 03:06:18.560
And my initial, like, knee-jerk reaction is,

03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:21.560
oh, it's not very Apple-like to, you know,

03:06:21.560 --> 03:06:22.560
release something that sucks.

03:06:22.560 --> 03:06:23.560
It feels like it.

03:06:23.560 --> 03:06:24.560
But yeah, I hear you now.

03:06:24.560 --> 03:06:26.560
But it's actually very Apple-like.

03:06:26.560 --> 03:06:29.560
They just also replace it really quickly.

03:06:29.560 --> 03:06:30.560
Exactly.

03:06:30.560 --> 03:06:32.560
So they released the first generation product

03:06:32.560 --> 03:06:35.560
to the public as a dev kit.

03:06:35.560 --> 03:06:37.560
But instead of charging dev kit-like pricing,

03:06:37.560 --> 03:06:39.560
they charge retail-like pricing.

03:06:39.560 --> 03:06:40.560
Like pricing, yeah.

03:06:40.560 --> 03:06:42.560
And no, no, dev kits are typically more.

03:06:42.560 --> 03:06:43.560
I mean, they charge, like...

03:06:43.560 --> 03:06:44.560
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:06:44.560 --> 03:06:45.560
Like consumer pricing.

03:06:45.560 --> 03:06:48.560
And consumers can buy it if they want to be

03:06:48.560 --> 03:06:51.560
part of the experience and live on the bleeding edge.

03:06:51.560 --> 03:06:55.560
But understand that this thing is probably going to go away

03:06:55.560 --> 03:06:57.560
in terms of software support

03:06:57.560 --> 03:07:00.560
because devs are going to come up with really amazing things

03:07:00.560 --> 03:07:01.560
that you can do with the Apple headset.

03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:04.560
And Apple's going to build new capabilities

03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:05.560
into that next headset.

03:07:05.560 --> 03:07:07.560
They're going to iterate fast.

03:07:07.560 --> 03:07:09.560
And you're going to get left behind.

03:07:09.560 --> 03:07:11.560
And as long as it doesn't cost too much money,

03:07:11.560 --> 03:07:12.560
I guess that's okay.

03:07:12.560 --> 03:07:14.560
Or maybe if it does cost too much money,

03:07:14.560 --> 03:07:15.560
I guess that's okay too,

03:07:15.560 --> 03:07:18.560
because you like giving Apple your money.

03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:20.560
Like I don't think the iPhone really got good

03:07:20.560 --> 03:07:23.560
until the iPhone 4.

03:07:23.560 --> 03:07:25.560
And maybe that's partly just personal bias

03:07:25.560 --> 03:07:27.560
because that's when I bought an iPhone.

03:07:27.560 --> 03:07:30.560
But that was the first time I felt compelled to own one.

03:07:30.560 --> 03:07:34.560
I think the iPhone 3G was still a pretty massive paradigm shift.

03:07:35.560 --> 03:07:36.560
That's fair.

03:07:36.560 --> 03:07:38.560
It felt extremely like cheap.

03:07:38.560 --> 03:07:39.560
I don't know.

03:07:39.560 --> 03:07:40.560
I don't know if I would say, yeah,

03:07:40.560 --> 03:07:42.560
I don't know if I was lying if it was good yet,

03:07:42.560 --> 03:07:45.560
but it was still like.

03:07:45.560 --> 03:07:47.560
That was still the big moment.

03:07:47.560 --> 03:07:50.560
I think in my opinion.

03:07:50.560 --> 03:07:52.560
A 3G S wasn't bad.

03:07:52.560 --> 03:07:56.560
People are saying because that one was a lot faster.

03:07:56.560 --> 03:07:58.560
Like a lot faster.

03:07:58.560 --> 03:08:01.560
I never had any of them.

03:08:01.560 --> 03:08:03.560
So I don't know.

03:08:03.560 --> 03:08:05.560
I don't know.

03:08:09.560 --> 03:08:12.560
It's LMG invited to WWDC.

03:08:12.560 --> 03:08:14.560
No.

03:08:14.560 --> 03:08:17.560
Apple and I have no longer been friends on Facebook

03:08:17.560 --> 03:08:19.560
for a long time.

03:08:19.560 --> 03:08:22.560
We were never friends on Facebook.

03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:24.560
Friendship, friendship.

03:08:24.560 --> 03:08:26.560
Not ended with Apple.

03:08:26.560 --> 03:08:29.560
Yeah, friendship never started.

03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:32.560
Apple's one of those companies that you have to play the game.

03:08:32.560 --> 03:08:35.560
You have to cover them the way they want to be covered.

03:08:35.560 --> 03:08:39.560
And my understanding is MAC address actually has a relationship

03:08:39.560 --> 03:08:41.560
with Apple now.

03:08:41.560 --> 03:08:45.560
But the second I found out about that, I went cool.

03:08:45.560 --> 03:08:47.560
I'm not going to be involved at all.

03:08:47.560 --> 03:08:49.560
Probably good.

03:08:49.560 --> 03:08:53.560
Which is almost certainly for the best.

03:08:53.560 --> 03:08:57.560
I think they need to just do their thing and not let me talk

03:08:57.560 --> 03:09:00.560
to Apple at all because I would almost certainly say something

03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:02.560
that's not Apple friendly.

03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:04.560
Okay, so yes.

03:09:04.560 --> 03:09:07.560
But even outside of that, just like the association,

03:09:07.560 --> 03:09:10.560
like if they just treat MAC address like it's own encapsulated thing.

03:09:10.560 --> 03:09:13.560
Well, they know that MAC address is under the LMG umbrella.

03:09:13.560 --> 03:09:15.560
It's not a secret.

03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:18.560
But we talked about that when we were starting the channel.

03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:21.560
We had serious internal discussions.

03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:27.560
Do we stealthily make this thing completely separate

03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:32.560
knowing that that could facilitate building a relationship with Apple

03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:37.560
but could blow up in our face when people figure out later

03:09:37.560 --> 03:09:39.560
that it was part of the LMG umbrella.

03:09:39.560 --> 03:09:43.560
Or do we just own that it's part of LMG up front, be transparent,

03:09:43.560 --> 03:09:45.560
even if it costs us every building that relationship.

03:09:45.560 --> 03:09:49.560
So we just have to like buy samples and do videos later forever

03:09:49.560 --> 03:09:52.560
because we'll never get a reviewer relationship.

03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:54.560
We'll never get our questions answered.

03:09:54.560 --> 03:09:58.560
Knowing also though that the benefit will be that we can grow the channel faster.

03:09:58.560 --> 03:09:59.560
There's all these pros and cons.

03:09:59.560 --> 03:10:02.560
And ultimately we went with transparency.

03:10:02.560 --> 03:10:06.560
I just don't like drama.

03:10:06.560 --> 03:10:07.560
I just don't need it in my life.

03:10:07.560 --> 03:10:11.560
And I guess a lot easier to just be upfront with people.

03:10:11.560 --> 03:10:15.560
Which again, like makes it that much more triggering for me

03:10:15.560 --> 03:10:18.560
when I see conspiracy theories about how I'm accepting,

03:10:18.560 --> 03:10:21.560
you know, under the table sponsorships from doing this from doing that.

03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:24.560
If I was doing any of that stuff, like look at the kind of turnover

03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:25.560
there is in the tech industry.

03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:29.560
You think someone would have talked at some point about how much

03:10:29.560 --> 03:10:33.560
under the table money I took?

03:10:33.560 --> 03:10:35.560
Whatever.

03:10:35.560 --> 03:10:37.560
I think we should hit up merge messages.

03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:38.560
Let's hit up some merge messages.

03:10:38.560 --> 03:10:40.560
We're at over three hours for the runtime.

03:10:40.560 --> 03:10:42.560
What?

03:10:42.560 --> 03:10:49.560
Yeah, I said you had 10 minutes left and then you did like 14 more topics.

03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:52.560
I want to go to lunch with Dr. Cuttrus after when?

03:10:52.560 --> 03:10:53.560
If I can bring Wendell.

03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:54.560
Yeah, sure.

03:10:54.560 --> 03:10:56.560
Because I was planning on going with Wendell.

03:10:56.560 --> 03:10:59.560
But meeting up with Dr. Cuttrus would be fantastic.

03:10:59.560 --> 03:11:00.560
I haven't seen him in the soul show.

03:11:00.560 --> 03:11:01.560
Yeah, let's go.

03:11:01.560 --> 03:11:04.560
Sweet.

03:11:04.560 --> 03:11:06.560
Man, now I'm looking forward to lunch.

03:11:06.560 --> 03:11:09.560
Okay, we're going to do these merge messages pretty fast here.

03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:13.560
Hey, Andy, should we turn off the light?

03:11:13.560 --> 03:11:15.560
Merch messages after dark?

03:11:15.560 --> 03:11:17.560
I mean, let's see how much of an effect it has.

03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:18.560
I kind of feel like not much.

03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:23.560
I could just take down that grade.

03:11:23.560 --> 03:11:25.560
That's probably too dark.

03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:31.560
Does that have a fade on it at all?

03:11:31.560 --> 03:11:32.560
What is it?

03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:33.560
Oh.

03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:39.560
Don't step into that light.

03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:42.560
That's how you know you're dead.

03:11:42.560 --> 03:11:43.560
Sure.

03:11:43.560 --> 03:11:46.560
Yeah, we'll call that Wendell after dark.

03:11:47.560 --> 03:11:48.560
Yeah.

03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:49.560
It's noon.

03:11:49.560 --> 03:11:50.560
It's pretty late.

03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:51.560
All right.

03:11:51.560 --> 03:11:52.560
It's in the afternoon now.

03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:53.560
Okay, let's get into it.

03:11:53.560 --> 03:11:54.560
Morning merge messages.

03:11:54.560 --> 03:11:55.560
Morning merge messages.

03:11:55.560 --> 03:11:57.560
Good morning, merge messages.

03:11:57.560 --> 03:11:58.560
Hi, peeps.

03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:02.560
In retrospect, two reviews like the Ally one that come out way

03:12:02.560 --> 03:12:05.560
before the actual release date, would it be fair to make the

03:12:05.560 --> 03:12:10.560
review closer to the release date as things may change?

03:12:10.560 --> 03:12:11.560
That's a really good question.

03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:15.560
And I think this was probably prompted by Dave 2D's video on

03:12:15.560 --> 03:12:20.560
the Ally where the title was basically don't trust other reviews

03:12:20.560 --> 03:12:27.560
of the ROG Ally and kind of talks about covering the product later.

03:12:27.560 --> 03:12:32.560
And I, you know, I like Dave.

03:12:32.560 --> 03:12:34.560
I've met Dave before.

03:12:34.560 --> 03:12:39.560
And honestly, there's no real way for me to sugarcoat this though.

03:12:39.560 --> 03:12:41.560
I think that's a shockingly bad take.

03:12:42.560 --> 03:12:49.560
You cover a product when the manufacturer says it's done and to

03:12:49.560 --> 03:12:52.560
not cover it at that point.

03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:58.560
Like you can make your decision to not cover it because you think

03:12:58.560 --> 03:13:01.560
it's not in a good enough state or whatever else.

03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:08.560
But at the end of the day, to say that another media publication

03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:17.560
did anything wrong or that readers and viewers shouldn't trust

03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:23.560
another review because it was done at an earlier stage in the

03:13:23.560 --> 03:13:28.560
product's lifetime is sort of puzzling to me.

03:13:28.560 --> 03:13:33.560
Like I think there is an absolute benefit to covering products

03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:35.560
over their lifespan.

03:13:35.560 --> 03:13:37.560
So I don't disagree with that.

03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:39.560
I think that's really good.

03:13:39.560 --> 03:13:44.560
But at the end of the day, we can only cover what we're given.

03:13:44.560 --> 03:13:50.560
And when the manufacturer says, hey, this is prime time, we're not

03:13:50.560 --> 03:13:55.560
in a position to say, no, we disagree that it's prime time.

03:13:55.560 --> 03:14:00.560
We're going to cover it when it's like more prime timer.

03:14:00.560 --> 03:14:04.560
Our job is to say, you know, hey, this is the day that pre-orders

03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:07.560
are going up and this is the state of this product.

03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:12.560
Because ASUS might fix it more or they might not.

03:14:12.560 --> 03:14:15.560
And if they don't, you need to understand exactly what it is

03:14:15.560 --> 03:14:16.560
you're buying.

03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:18.560
They said it was done.

03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:22.560
And so if they think it's done, then as far as I'm concerned,

03:14:22.560 --> 03:14:24.560
they could stop development tomorrow.

03:14:24.560 --> 03:14:26.560
They probably won't.

03:14:27.560 --> 03:14:29.560
But they could.

03:14:29.560 --> 03:14:38.560
And so you have to cover things as they are rather than covering

03:14:38.560 --> 03:14:39.560
them as they will be.

03:14:39.560 --> 03:14:42.560
You can acknowledge what they might be.

03:14:42.560 --> 03:14:47.560
You can talk about what the brand says they might do.

03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:50.560
But no, you've got to.

03:14:50.560 --> 03:14:52.560
Yeah, you got to.

03:15:03.560 --> 03:15:06.560
Next up.

03:15:06.560 --> 03:15:09.560
I forget what the actual question was.

03:15:09.560 --> 03:15:11.560
Why don't you really feel like reviewing it?

03:15:11.560 --> 03:15:13.560
Yeah.

03:15:13.560 --> 03:15:19.560
No, we should review it when ASUS asks for pre-order money.

03:15:19.560 --> 03:15:21.560
They're asking for your money.

03:15:21.560 --> 03:15:25.560
As far as I'm concerned, the second a brand is asking for your money,

03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:29.560
we need to take a close look at exactly what you're getting for it.

03:15:29.560 --> 03:15:32.560
And then if that changes over time, hey, that's great.

03:15:32.560 --> 03:15:34.560
I mean, Val has done a great job of that with the Steam Deck.

03:15:34.560 --> 03:15:36.560
But we can take it for granted.

03:15:36.560 --> 03:15:42.560
And if other publications cover it closer to the availability date,

03:15:42.560 --> 03:15:44.560
a month after the availability date,

03:15:44.560 --> 03:15:46.560
six months after the availability date, I hope.

03:15:46.560 --> 03:15:47.560
Check them out.

03:15:47.560 --> 03:15:48.560
Yeah, check it out.

03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:50.560
We had this conversation earlier in the show.

03:15:50.560 --> 03:15:51.560
We don't all have to say the same thing.

03:15:51.560 --> 03:15:52.560
You don't like.

03:15:52.560 --> 03:15:53.560
Yes.

03:15:53.560 --> 03:15:57.560
It's not of particular benefit to you for like every single reviewer

03:15:57.560 --> 03:16:01.560
to release identical videos all at the exact same minute.

03:16:01.560 --> 03:16:04.560
Like just whatever.

03:16:04.560 --> 03:16:05.560
Yes.

03:16:05.560 --> 03:16:06.560
Game link is real.

03:16:06.560 --> 03:16:07.560
Lakeways and Floatplane chat.

03:16:07.560 --> 03:16:11.560
Go subscribe.

03:16:11.560 --> 03:16:12.560
Okay.

03:16:12.560 --> 03:16:14.560
Up next is from David.

03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:17.560
What is the most interesting thing you saw at Computex

03:16:17.560 --> 03:16:24.560
that you thought wouldn't make a good video?

03:16:24.560 --> 03:16:27.560
Oh, that's a really good question.

03:16:27.560 --> 03:16:28.560
That's a very good question.

03:16:28.560 --> 03:16:29.560
I like this one a lot.

03:16:29.560 --> 03:16:30.560
Yeah.

03:16:30.560 --> 03:16:31.560
Because you got two brains.

03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:32.560
You got two brains, don't you?

03:16:32.560 --> 03:16:33.560
Wow, this thing's cool.

03:16:33.560 --> 03:16:36.560
Nobody cares.

03:16:36.560 --> 03:16:37.560
Yeah.

03:16:37.560 --> 03:16:39.560
That happens to me a lot at these type of shows,

03:16:39.560 --> 03:16:40.560
but it doesn't on the show for us.

03:16:40.560 --> 03:16:42.560
This is a whole line.

03:16:42.560 --> 03:16:45.560
Holy crap.

03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:46.560
Okay.

03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:47.560
Yeah.

03:16:47.560 --> 03:16:52.560
I, uh, I swung by like the USB IF booth.

03:16:52.560 --> 03:16:57.560
Um, and they had just like vendor showcases of,

03:16:57.560 --> 03:16:59.560
of, of cool tech that's coming.

03:16:59.560 --> 03:17:03.560
And, uh, they, they had, um, I think it was either a live demo

03:17:03.560 --> 03:17:06.560
or it was just some information on like USB 80 gig,

03:17:06.560 --> 03:17:08.560
like 80 gigabit.

03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:11.560
And I was like, wow.

03:17:11.560 --> 03:17:12.560
See you later.

03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:14.560
That booth is always fun to go by.

03:17:14.560 --> 03:17:15.560
Yeah.

03:17:15.560 --> 03:17:16.560
And never worth making a video.

03:17:16.560 --> 03:17:17.560
Yeah.

03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:18.560
But like, yeah, absolutely.

03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:21.560
Every time it's here at school and they're here every time.

03:17:21.560 --> 03:17:26.560
So, and there's, I love going through, there's like,

03:17:26.560 --> 03:17:27.560
I wasn't there this year.

03:17:27.560 --> 03:17:28.560
So I'm going to describe it poorly,

03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:29.560
but there's one side of the hall,

03:17:29.560 --> 03:17:32.560
which is like more consumer focused stuff than there's the other

03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:34.560
side of the hall, which is like, you know,

03:17:34.560 --> 03:17:37.560
the, the companies that actually make the things that a lot of the

03:17:37.560 --> 03:17:38.560
brands are branding.

03:17:38.560 --> 03:17:41.560
Um, going through that section is very interesting.

03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:42.560
Yeah.

03:17:42.560 --> 03:17:43.560
I think we did a video on that one year actually.

03:17:43.560 --> 03:17:47.560
Uh, MSI makes a car charger apparently in some markets.

03:17:47.560 --> 03:17:48.560
That's right.

03:17:48.560 --> 03:17:50.560
So I was like, uh, okay.

03:17:50.560 --> 03:17:54.560
And, uh, oh, I dropped by, I dropped by this company that makes

03:17:54.560 --> 03:17:56.560
switches with screens on them.

03:17:56.560 --> 03:18:01.560
And it's for, it's for like aviation consoles and stuff like that.

03:18:01.560 --> 03:18:05.560
And the, so not like key switches, not for like a keyboard,

03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:08.560
but well the art, but not for a keyboard,

03:18:08.560 --> 03:18:12.560
but like for, for like a giant dashboard, you know?

03:18:12.560 --> 03:18:16.560
Uh, and I was like, wow, super cool.

03:18:16.560 --> 03:18:17.560
See you later.

03:18:17.560 --> 03:18:22.560
Uh, yeah, what else man?

03:18:22.560 --> 03:18:26.560
That's, uh, this was like not, uh, not,

03:18:26.560 --> 03:18:31.560
not video worthy super micro had a really cool liquid cooled server.

03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:32.560
In fact,

03:18:32.560 --> 03:18:36.560
there's a ton of immersion and conventional liquid cooling server stuff.

03:18:36.560 --> 03:18:42.560
There's a lot of stuff that shows like this that like seven to 10 years ago,

03:18:42.560 --> 03:18:45.560
we probably would have made a bunch of videos about.

03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:49.560
Um, but at this point, especially with how YouTube is doing things,

03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:54.560
um, if those videos aren't just like bangers, it can hurt the channel.

03:18:54.560 --> 03:18:57.560
So you gotta be careful.

03:18:57.560 --> 03:18:58.560
Yeah.

03:18:58.560 --> 03:18:59.560
Okay. Hit me.

03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:00.560
Okay.

03:19:00.560 --> 03:19:03.560
So the next question is from the channel Linus in the event of your death,

03:19:03.560 --> 03:19:08.560
who would you want to sponsor your funeral and how would the segue go?

03:19:08.560 --> 03:19:10.560
I would expect it to be D brand.

03:19:10.560 --> 03:19:11.560
I would hope it was.

03:19:11.560 --> 03:19:12.560
Yeah, that's like,

03:19:12.560 --> 03:19:18.560
if my, if my coffin didn't have like a Damascus vinyl skin on it,

03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:20.560
I'd be extremely disappointed.

03:19:20.560 --> 03:19:21.560
You have to,

03:19:21.560 --> 03:19:23.560
you're coughing in your car, have to match.

03:19:23.560 --> 03:19:24.560
Yeah.

03:19:24.560 --> 03:19:26.560
Oh, I'm crying with tears of laughter.

03:19:26.560 --> 03:19:29.560
I'm trying to put it in a hearse that is also wrapped.

03:19:29.560 --> 03:19:31.560
Well, yeah. They could. Well, no, no, it would be,

03:19:31.560 --> 03:19:32.560
it wouldn't need to be a hearse.

03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:34.560
They could just get the longer tycan,

03:19:34.560 --> 03:19:38.560
rip out the back seats and throw me in there.

03:19:38.560 --> 03:19:39.560
I'm thinking.

03:19:39.560 --> 03:19:40.560
You wouldn't even need to rip out the back seats.

03:19:40.560 --> 03:19:42.560
I'm not that tall.

03:19:42.560 --> 03:19:45.560
Just stop me in the trunk.

03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:49.560
Oh boy. Yeah.

03:19:49.560 --> 03:19:51.560
So actually, you know.

03:19:51.560 --> 03:19:54.560
You have a bond to a speech.

03:19:54.560 --> 03:19:57.560
It's just a segue to a sponsor.

03:19:57.560 --> 03:20:00.560
Yeah, I'm going to ask for a commitment right now.

03:20:00.560 --> 03:20:01.560
Actually. Oh no.

03:20:01.560 --> 03:20:05.560
The message.

03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:09.560
I'm live on the WAN show right now and I need you to commit to

03:20:09.560 --> 03:20:12.560
sponsoring my funeral if I die.

03:20:12.560 --> 03:20:16.560
Period. I expect the coffin to be wrapped in whatever your

03:20:16.560 --> 03:20:21.560
gaudiest tackiest pattern is.

03:20:21.560 --> 03:20:22.560
Okay, I will.

03:20:22.560 --> 03:20:24.560
I will literally just send that to D brand.

03:20:24.560 --> 03:20:27.560
I will let you guys know.

03:20:27.560 --> 03:20:29.560
I'll let you know what they say,

03:20:29.560 --> 03:20:31.560
assuming they get back to me in a timely manner here.

03:20:31.560 --> 03:20:33.560
I think you're crying.

03:20:33.560 --> 03:20:38.560
Oh, okay.

03:20:38.560 --> 03:20:41.560
Hey, LTD team Linus Luke.

03:20:41.560 --> 03:20:45.560
I have a question rewatching the office moving vlogs in them.

03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:49.560
Linus keeps referring to having to move and inspectors making

03:20:49.560 --> 03:20:51.560
sure you are moved out.

03:20:51.560 --> 03:20:53.560
Did anyone kick you out?

03:20:53.560 --> 03:20:56.560
Yes. Yeah.

03:20:56.560 --> 03:21:01.560
You see, we had a certain caretaker for the property.

03:21:01.560 --> 03:21:04.560
That never did anything.

03:21:04.560 --> 03:21:07.560
And so the neighbors got mad about the state of the property and

03:21:07.560 --> 03:21:10.560
started poking around and realized we were running a commercial

03:21:10.560 --> 03:21:11.560
entity there.

03:21:11.560 --> 03:21:16.560
The good news is by the time this whole thing came to a head.

03:21:16.560 --> 03:21:18.560
We were already planning to move anyway.

03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:20.560
So when the city came and said, hey,

03:21:20.560 --> 03:21:22.560
you guys need to move or we're going to start finding you like

03:21:22.560 --> 03:21:24.560
thousands of dollars a day.

03:21:24.560 --> 03:21:27.560
We were like, hey, hey, hold on, hold on, hold on.

03:21:27.560 --> 03:21:31.560
The only reason that we haven't moved yet is because of like city

03:21:31.560 --> 03:21:32.560
permitting issues.

03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:34.560
So like, can we chill?

03:21:34.560 --> 03:21:37.560
Can we work together to get us out of here?

03:21:37.560 --> 03:21:39.560
It was never supposed to grow this big.

03:21:39.560 --> 03:21:44.560
It was supposed to be small and everything was fine.

03:21:45.560 --> 03:21:52.560
Yeah. And they were like, okay.

03:21:52.560 --> 03:21:55.560
So we got that all, we got that all sorted out,

03:21:55.560 --> 03:21:59.560
but it did mean that we had to get in there a little bit sooner

03:21:59.560 --> 03:22:04.560
than the building was actually ready because our other contractor

03:22:04.560 --> 03:22:08.560
who we've worked with a few times in a mostly fairly pretty good,

03:22:08.560 --> 03:22:13.560
okay, pretty okay, pretty good martini construction.

03:22:13.560 --> 03:22:18.560
They were experiencing some delays at that time.

03:22:18.560 --> 03:22:23.560
Overall, shout out Sharma.

03:22:23.560 --> 03:22:24.560
Pretty shout out martini.

03:22:24.560 --> 03:22:27.560
They're pretty okay.

03:22:27.560 --> 03:22:29.560
Not shout out GRN pool and landscape.

03:22:29.560 --> 03:22:34.560
That's where I'm at.

03:22:34.560 --> 03:22:36.560
Hey guys, from recent coverage,

03:22:36.560 --> 03:22:39.560
you clearly have a great relationship with reps from tech

03:22:39.560 --> 03:22:42.560
companies as previously unshared stories of reps just coming

03:22:42.560 --> 03:22:46.560
through and helping you out big time.

03:22:46.560 --> 03:22:48.560
Oh, I mean, it's endless, right?

03:22:48.560 --> 03:22:51.560
How could we do anything that we do without help from these

03:22:51.560 --> 03:22:54.560
passionate people at these companies that, you know,

03:22:54.560 --> 03:22:57.560
just want people to see and enjoy their products, right?

03:22:57.560 --> 03:23:02.560
Like it's, I know it sounds really cheesy when I say it like that,

03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:07.560
but there is no, there is no wizard hiding in the side room.

03:23:07.560 --> 03:23:08.560
There is no scooby-doo.

03:23:08.560 --> 03:23:14.560
Aha, that like really is it for a lot of people who work in the

03:23:14.560 --> 03:23:15.560
tech industry.

03:23:15.560 --> 03:23:18.560
And it's one of the reasons that like compensation in the tech

03:23:18.560 --> 03:23:21.560
industry kind of sucks because people are so passionate about it.

03:23:21.560 --> 03:23:24.560
They just like really want to build cool tech products.

03:23:24.560 --> 03:23:28.560
And that's a shame, but it's also really cool that everyone's

03:23:28.560 --> 03:23:29.560
so passionate.

03:23:29.560 --> 03:23:32.560
So I don't know what to tell you.

03:23:32.560 --> 03:23:35.560
You know, I want everyone to be compensated fairly,

03:23:35.560 --> 03:23:39.560
but I also want to work with people who are super passionate.

03:23:39.560 --> 03:23:41.560
And I think there are some employers that will always try to

03:23:41.560 --> 03:23:45.560
leverage that, right?

03:23:45.560 --> 03:23:48.560
Was there anything that made you personally excited that won't

03:23:48.560 --> 03:23:50.560
make its way into a video?

03:23:50.560 --> 03:23:53.560
And what was it?

03:23:53.560 --> 03:23:55.560
I think we just did that.

03:23:55.560 --> 03:23:57.560
Yeah, I think this is more excited.

03:23:57.560 --> 03:24:00.560
I mean, I wasn't excited by the switch.

03:24:00.560 --> 03:24:03.560
No, this, I think this is more general than,

03:24:04.560 --> 03:24:06.560
than Computex and Computex.

03:24:06.560 --> 03:24:07.560
Yeah.

03:24:07.560 --> 03:24:09.560
I think it was Computex.

03:24:09.560 --> 03:24:10.560
Okay.

03:24:10.560 --> 03:24:11.560
Moving on then.

03:24:11.560 --> 03:24:13.560
Well, I mean, I'm still thinking.

03:24:13.560 --> 03:24:14.560
Oh, okay.

03:24:14.560 --> 03:24:15.560
Sorry.

03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:21.560
Made me excited, but won't make its way into a video.

03:24:21.560 --> 03:24:23.560
Never mind them over it.

03:24:23.560 --> 03:24:27.560
Do you see the opportunity for a physics like add in card for

03:24:27.560 --> 03:24:30.560
AI with games moving forward?

03:24:30.560 --> 03:24:31.560
No.

03:24:31.560 --> 03:24:32.560
No.

03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:34.560
We're going to use our, we're going to use our GPUs for AI.

03:24:34.560 --> 03:24:39.560
We've already, the, the, the, the, the time for more add in

03:24:39.560 --> 03:24:44.560
cards, I think is past and the time of, of tightly integrated

03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:48.560
chips is now old man.

03:24:48.560 --> 03:24:49.560
Yeah.

03:24:49.560 --> 03:24:51.560
Hi, LLD been watching since 2011.

03:24:51.560 --> 03:24:56.560
What did you think about the modded 3070 with 60 gigs of 16 gigs

03:24:56.560 --> 03:24:57.560
of RAM?

03:24:57.560 --> 03:25:00.560
And what do you guys think that Nvidia will do with the

03:25:00.560 --> 03:25:02.560
companies behind those mods?

03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:03.560
Great job.

03:25:03.560 --> 03:25:05.560
Nvidia will ignore it.

03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:06.560
And what do I think about it?

03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:09.560
I think it's super cool and I'm really frustrated because we

03:25:09.560 --> 03:25:14.560
actually had the idea of modding additional VRAM on GPUs and

03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:16.560
testing them like years ago.

03:25:16.560 --> 03:25:21.560
And I asked Gary, who now works for us, but previously worked

03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:25.560
at ASUS, if he could facilitate getting us access to the gear

03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:27.560
that we would need to do something like that, or at the

03:25:27.560 --> 03:25:30.560
very least recommending what gear we would need to do it.

03:25:30.560 --> 03:25:32.560
And he was like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

03:25:32.560 --> 03:25:33.560
Boom.

03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:36.560
Other people did it.

03:25:36.560 --> 03:25:42.560
So thanks, Gary.

03:25:42.560 --> 03:25:43.560
Love you all.

03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:44.560
Now everyone's doing it.

03:25:44.560 --> 03:25:47.560
Oh, well, you still have to, you still have a chance to miss it

03:25:47.560 --> 03:25:48.560
by another couple of years.

03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:49.560
Love you all.

03:25:49.560 --> 03:25:50.560
First purchase.

03:25:50.560 --> 03:25:53.560
Buying ABC for a dear friend's new baby.

03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:57.560
With Yvonne being the behind the scenes superstar she is,

03:25:57.560 --> 03:26:00.560
what are some of the ways she enjoys feeling celebrated?

03:26:00.560 --> 03:26:03.560
Your dynamic is inspiring.

03:26:03.560 --> 03:26:05.560
She name companies after her.

03:26:05.560 --> 03:26:06.560
She just really appreciates.

03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:07.560
No, she doesn't like that.

03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:09.560
Yvonne umbrella court.

03:26:09.560 --> 03:26:14.560
The problem with the problem for Yvonne, I think, is that I

03:26:14.560 --> 03:26:15.560
appreciate her.

03:26:15.560 --> 03:26:22.560
I know what she does, but she feels and in some cases it's

03:26:22.560 --> 03:26:24.560
not accurate, but in other cases it is.

03:26:24.560 --> 03:26:28.560
She feels like other people don't necessarily know or appreciate

03:26:28.560 --> 03:26:29.560
what she does.

03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:31.560
And so she doesn't want to hear it from me.

03:26:31.560 --> 03:26:33.560
Like, you know, good job, honey.

03:26:33.560 --> 03:26:35.560
Here's your quarterly performance review.

03:26:35.560 --> 03:26:36.560
A plus.

03:26:36.560 --> 03:26:38.560
Like that means nothing to her.

03:26:38.560 --> 03:26:43.560
You know, what she, what she enjoys is being appreciated by the

03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:49.560
people at work or by, um, by partners or by like, I, like I know

03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:53.560
there, there are at least one member of one of our families.

03:26:53.560 --> 03:26:55.560
I'm keeping this as vague as I can.

03:26:55.560 --> 03:26:58.560
Um, not that it'll make a difference because, you know, I

03:26:58.560 --> 03:27:03.560
guess you might know who you are that just doesn't seem to

03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:07.560
understand that she doesn't just hang out at her husband's

03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:09.560
business all day.

03:27:09.560 --> 03:27:13.560
You know, like, I remember a comment was made at some point,

03:27:13.560 --> 03:27:16.560
like three years after our last kid was born, it was like, so are

03:27:16.560 --> 03:27:18.560
you ever going to go back to work?

03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:23.560
And she's like, what, you mean in the pharmacy?

03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:26.560
You understand that I am at work, right?

03:27:26.560 --> 03:27:28.560
That I never stopped working really.

03:27:28.560 --> 03:27:36.560
Um, how many times do I have to tell you that I work for our

03:27:36.560 --> 03:27:37.560
company?

03:27:37.560 --> 03:27:40.560
Uh, like it just, yeah, it's just, it's just rude, right?

03:27:40.560 --> 03:27:41.560
Like it's ridiculous.

03:27:41.560 --> 03:27:47.560
Um, you know, I think that, you know, for her, it's, it's the

03:27:48.560 --> 03:27:49.560
there are things that I can do.

03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:53.560
Like she appreciates it when I notice just, you know, casual

03:27:53.560 --> 03:27:54.560
misogyny.

03:27:54.560 --> 03:27:56.560
And that's not a word that I throw around, right?

03:27:56.560 --> 03:28:01.560
Like I think that misogyny has come to mean just anything at

03:28:01.560 --> 03:28:02.560
this point.

03:28:02.560 --> 03:28:06.560
Um, I think it's, it's, it's a lost a lot of its original

03:28:06.560 --> 03:28:09.560
meaning because now all of a sudden everything is misogyny and

03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:11.560
it's, it's, it's not.

03:28:11.560 --> 03:28:14.560
Um, but there, but there are things that are, you know, like

03:28:14.560 --> 03:28:18.560
the way that, uh, you know, a contractor will come to the door

03:28:18.560 --> 03:28:22.560
and I'll answer the door and they'll ask a bunch of questions

03:28:22.560 --> 03:28:24.560
and I'll be like, yeah, I actually don't know.

03:28:24.560 --> 03:28:26.560
Um, my wife knows that.

03:28:26.560 --> 03:28:27.560
Give me a second.

03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:30.560
I'll go get her and then I'll stand there and they'll keep

03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:34.560
talking to me even though she, so she's talking to them, but

03:28:34.560 --> 03:28:35.560
they're looking at me.

03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:36.560
Yeah.

03:28:36.560 --> 03:28:39.560
My, my, my girlfriend is buying a car and she's in the car

03:28:39.560 --> 03:28:40.560
with me.

03:28:40.560 --> 03:28:43.560
She's asking the questions and the dude is looking at her

03:28:43.560 --> 03:28:46.560
while she's asking the question and then looks at me and answers

03:28:46.560 --> 03:28:47.560
the question.

03:28:47.560 --> 03:28:48.560
Like, what do you do it?

03:28:48.560 --> 03:28:49.560
Yeah.

03:28:49.560 --> 03:28:53.560
Um, so she, you know, she appreciates it when I, when I notice

03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:56.560
and, you know, just, you know, give her a little pat on the back

03:28:56.560 --> 03:28:58.560
after like, Hey, I noticed and that wasn't cool.

03:28:58.560 --> 03:29:01.560
Um, you know, obviously we're not going to make a scene about

03:29:01.560 --> 03:29:06.560
something stupid like that, but like, Hey, I felt your pain

03:29:06.560 --> 03:29:08.560
there or I was aware of it.

03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:12.560
Um, and it's, you know, it's, it's similar with stuff, uh, with

03:29:12.560 --> 03:29:13.560
stuff to do with work as well.

03:29:13.560 --> 03:29:19.560
Like when, you know, when someone walks up to me and thanks

03:29:19.560 --> 03:29:24.560
me for throwing a Christmas party when I didn't touch it.

03:29:24.560 --> 03:29:27.560
Um, and Yvonne did all the work and she's standing right there.

03:29:27.560 --> 03:29:31.560
Uh, I'll just be like, Hey, they mean thanks to you too.

03:29:31.560 --> 03:29:36.560
Uh, you know, like it's, it's tough, right?

03:29:36.560 --> 03:29:40.560
I do sometimes refer to you two as a unit.

03:29:40.560 --> 03:29:41.560
I know.

03:29:42.560 --> 03:29:45.560
Just, which I try to, I try to try to go the other way with it.

03:29:45.560 --> 03:29:46.560
I do.

03:29:46.560 --> 03:29:47.560
It's all I'll say.

03:29:47.560 --> 03:29:48.560
Yeah.

03:29:48.560 --> 03:29:49.560
Yeah.

03:29:49.560 --> 03:29:52.560
I like to think that I do better these days than I used to.

03:29:52.560 --> 03:29:54.560
I'll catch myself sometimes.

03:29:54.560 --> 03:29:56.560
And like, I contribute to the problem too.

03:29:56.560 --> 03:29:58.560
Like I went and named the stupid company after myself,

03:29:58.560 --> 03:30:00.560
which in retrospect was absolutely a mistake.

03:30:00.560 --> 03:30:02.560
I wish I called it something else.

03:30:02.560 --> 03:30:04.560
It's a lot of paperwork to change it now.

03:30:04.560 --> 03:30:05.560
Yeah.

03:30:05.560 --> 03:30:10.560
Uh, like really expensive.

03:30:11.560 --> 03:30:12.560
Yeah.

03:30:13.560 --> 03:30:14.560
Moving on.

03:30:14.560 --> 03:30:15.560
Okay.

03:30:15.560 --> 03:30:17.560
Hey gang, what in your opinion is the thing?

03:30:17.560 --> 03:30:18.560
Oh, hold on.

03:30:18.560 --> 03:30:19.560
People are, hold on.

03:30:19.560 --> 03:30:20.560
Hold on one quick thing.

03:30:20.560 --> 03:30:23.560
People are like, well, obviously you should just say it was all her.

03:30:23.560 --> 03:30:24.560
Right.

03:30:24.560 --> 03:30:27.560
But you got to understand that it's not that simple for people with that kind

03:30:27.560 --> 03:30:31.560
of mindset where like only a man could have done anything.

03:30:31.560 --> 03:30:34.560
Um, and she would say this and I, and I would,

03:30:34.560 --> 03:30:36.560
I was like kind of dismissive of it.

03:30:36.560 --> 03:30:39.560
I was like, no way, but she'd say like, no,

03:30:39.560 --> 03:30:43.560
if you do that, if you defend me, people just assume that it's fake

03:30:43.560 --> 03:30:46.560
attribution, that it's because I told you to do it.

03:30:46.560 --> 03:30:47.560
Yeah.

03:30:47.560 --> 03:30:49.560
And then I was like, no way.

03:30:49.560 --> 03:30:53.560
And we did it for a bit and she was right.

03:30:53.560 --> 03:30:55.560
People just have their minds made up.

03:30:55.560 --> 03:30:56.560
They see whatever they want to see,

03:30:56.560 --> 03:30:58.560
they hear whatever they want to hear.

03:30:58.560 --> 03:31:02.560
And I don't mean that universally, but some people do.

03:31:02.560 --> 03:31:04.560
And so you just have to kind of go, you know, yeah,

03:31:04.560 --> 03:31:06.560
I'm, I'm sorry that happened.

03:31:06.560 --> 03:31:07.560
I'm not sucked.

03:31:07.560 --> 03:31:11.560
Um, I know what you did.

03:31:11.560 --> 03:31:15.560
And yeah, go ahead.

03:31:15.560 --> 03:31:16.560
Sorry, Dan, go ahead.

03:31:16.560 --> 03:31:17.560
Nope.

03:31:17.560 --> 03:31:18.560
That's totally fine.

03:31:18.560 --> 03:31:20.560
Hey gang, what in your opinion is the thing,

03:31:20.560 --> 03:31:24.560
the tech community strongly demands or desires that you know,

03:31:24.560 --> 03:31:28.560
we'll end up being something that everyone will regret wanting.

03:31:28.560 --> 03:31:34.560
Geez, what is with these questions?

03:31:34.560 --> 03:31:36.560
How am I supposed to?

03:31:37.560 --> 03:31:39.560
How am I supposed to do that?

03:31:39.560 --> 03:31:43.560
I mean, I think, I think we could have called it on horse armor.

03:31:43.560 --> 03:31:49.560
Um, what else though?

03:31:49.560 --> 03:31:53.560
Do you think like, do you think AI and gaming is going to be one of

03:31:53.560 --> 03:31:57.560
those things we regret, regret, regret wanting?

03:31:57.560 --> 03:31:59.560
No, I think that'll be really cool.

03:31:59.560 --> 03:32:00.560
Yep.

03:32:00.560 --> 03:32:04.560
What are we going to regret wanting?

03:32:04.560 --> 03:32:07.560
I think that's what I was thinking earlier in the show,

03:32:07.560 --> 03:32:10.560
people wanting all the reviewers opinion is to be the same.

03:32:10.560 --> 03:32:13.560
I don't know if that really fits the spirit of this question,

03:32:13.560 --> 03:32:17.560
but I would say that I actually like, I, I know I'm like making a

03:32:17.560 --> 03:32:19.560
big deal about it, but I think that's extremely bad.

03:32:19.560 --> 03:32:22.560
And like people need to really crush that immediately.

03:32:22.560 --> 03:32:25.560
But you know what, I like it.

03:32:25.560 --> 03:32:26.560
Good job.

03:32:26.560 --> 03:32:27.560
Cool.

03:32:27.560 --> 03:32:28.560
Got him.

03:32:28.560 --> 03:32:29.560
I agree with you.

03:32:29.560 --> 03:32:31.560
I have exactly the same cake.

03:32:31.560 --> 03:32:32.560
I do that to him all the time.

03:32:32.560 --> 03:32:33.560
I would see so good at this.

03:32:33.560 --> 03:32:35.560
In case people didn't get that.

03:32:35.560 --> 03:32:38.560
Oh, it's maddening.

03:32:38.560 --> 03:32:40.560
Hi Linus, Luke and Dan.

03:32:40.560 --> 03:32:43.560
Love all the Computex covering from LZT and other outlets this

03:32:43.560 --> 03:32:44.560
year.

03:32:44.560 --> 03:32:47.560
Has there been any tech trend good or otherwise from the

03:32:47.560 --> 03:32:50.560
different vendors that surprised you this year?

03:32:50.560 --> 03:32:54.560
I didn't expect behind the motherboard, you know, hidden

03:32:54.560 --> 03:32:57.560
connectors to get so much attention.

03:32:57.560 --> 03:32:59.560
It feels like the kind of thing we could have done forever

03:32:59.560 --> 03:33:01.560
ago and didn't.

03:33:01.560 --> 03:33:02.560
So I, I just,

03:33:02.560 --> 03:33:05.560
Not, not the, not the PC community, but like connectors on

03:33:05.560 --> 03:33:07.560
back and motherboard is not a new thing.

03:33:07.560 --> 03:33:08.560
No, no, not at all.

03:33:08.560 --> 03:33:10.560
It's just a new thing to gaming PCs.

03:33:10.560 --> 03:33:11.560
Yeah.

03:33:11.560 --> 03:33:12.560
Yeah.

03:33:12.560 --> 03:33:13.560
Yeah.

03:33:13.560 --> 03:33:16.560
And I'm, yeah, I'm, I don't know if I'm excited for it.

03:33:16.560 --> 03:33:19.560
Like we definitely need to see some new case designs to really

03:33:19.560 --> 03:33:24.560
get the most out of it, but I'm not not excited for it.

03:33:24.560 --> 03:33:25.560
Definitely.

03:33:25.560 --> 03:33:26.560
It surprised me.

03:33:26.560 --> 03:33:27.560
Yeah.

03:33:27.560 --> 03:33:28.560
Cool.

03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:29.560
I'm here.

03:33:29.560 --> 03:33:30.560
Okay.

03:33:30.560 --> 03:33:31.560
Another tech trend.

03:33:31.560 --> 03:33:36.560
I am amazed by the number of companies getting into like sim

03:33:36.560 --> 03:33:38.560
racing tech.

03:33:38.560 --> 03:33:40.560
Cooler master show off a chair.

03:33:40.560 --> 03:33:41.560
That has been weird, hasn't it?

03:33:41.560 --> 03:33:46.560
EK showed off this entire $25,000 kit.

03:33:46.560 --> 03:33:47.560
That was very surprising.

03:33:47.560 --> 03:33:48.560
EK of all.

03:33:48.560 --> 03:33:49.560
Yeah.

03:33:49.560 --> 03:33:51.560
I kept asking people like your shirt was EK.

03:33:51.560 --> 03:33:52.560
It wasn't like someone else.

03:33:52.560 --> 03:33:56.560
How many people are buying.

03:33:56.560 --> 03:33:58.560
Like multi access.

03:33:58.560 --> 03:34:01.560
I know there's absolutely for it, but like you think it would

03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:03.560
support like two brands total or something.

03:34:03.560 --> 03:34:04.560
Yeah.

03:34:04.560 --> 03:34:07.560
Not, not, not the amount that are in it.

03:34:07.560 --> 03:34:11.560
It's one of those things where like, I know what tooling costs.

03:34:11.560 --> 03:34:12.560
Yeah.

03:34:12.560 --> 03:34:13.560
It costs a lot.

03:34:13.560 --> 03:34:16.560
You got to be selling like thousands of something to make it

03:34:16.560 --> 03:34:18.560
make sense to manufacture it.

03:34:18.560 --> 03:34:19.560
Sort of.

03:34:19.560 --> 03:34:20.560
Depending on the price.

03:34:20.560 --> 03:34:23.560
Give room and full plane chat said it really took off with the

03:34:23.560 --> 03:34:24.560
pandemic.

03:34:24.560 --> 03:34:27.560
So I agree, especially like F one and stuff.

03:34:27.560 --> 03:34:28.560
Sim racing at home.

03:34:28.560 --> 03:34:31.560
Like the actual professional drivers were doing it on stream and

03:34:31.560 --> 03:34:32.560
stuff.

03:34:32.560 --> 03:34:33.560
Oh my God.

03:34:33.560 --> 03:34:35.560
Who was spending that kind of money on this sort of thing.

03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:38.560
Also sort of over.

03:34:38.560 --> 03:34:41.560
And we're already seeing consumer trends setting back to what

03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:42.560
they were before.

03:34:42.560 --> 03:34:44.560
I just, I don't know.

03:34:44.560 --> 03:34:45.560
I just don't get it.

03:34:45.560 --> 03:34:51.560
Like I'm, like I'm thinking about the amount of the amount of money

03:34:51.560 --> 03:35:00.560
I would have to be earning to spend $25,000 on a toy.

03:35:00.560 --> 03:35:02.560
And part of it.

03:35:02.560 --> 03:35:05.560
Because you're going to end up investing more or it's spending.

03:35:05.560 --> 03:35:08.560
I should be saying you're going to end up spending more for sure.

03:35:08.560 --> 03:35:11.560
Because that's like where you start, right?

03:35:12.560 --> 03:35:13.560
Yeah.

03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:16.560
And no, the pro drivers are not buying some kit from EK or some

03:35:16.560 --> 03:35:18.560
chair from cooler master.

03:35:18.560 --> 03:35:20.560
Like I just crazy stuff.

03:35:20.560 --> 03:35:21.560
Yeah.

03:35:21.560 --> 03:35:24.560
They are getting some consultant to come in and build them like a

03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:27.560
very custom like D box setup or whatever else.

03:35:27.560 --> 03:35:28.560
Right.

03:35:28.560 --> 03:35:30.560
Like I just, people are like, it's a hobby.

03:35:30.560 --> 03:35:31.560
Sure.

03:35:31.560 --> 03:35:32.560
What an insane hobby.

03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:35.560
It takes up so much space though.

03:35:35.560 --> 03:35:37.560
Like, wow.

03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:40.560
I just.

03:35:40.560 --> 03:35:41.560
And yes.

03:35:41.560 --> 03:35:42.560
Yes.

03:35:42.560 --> 03:35:45.560
I know they start at much, much lower prices for, for DIY kits.

03:35:45.560 --> 03:35:47.560
I just, it's one of those things.

03:35:47.560 --> 03:35:52.560
It's like a, it's like an Alienware laptop.

03:35:52.560 --> 03:35:58.560
In theory, these things exist or in theory, people are buying them.

03:35:58.560 --> 03:35:59.560
Otherwise they wouldn't exist.

03:35:59.560 --> 03:36:00.560
You never see them.

03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:01.560
But I've never seen one.

03:36:01.560 --> 03:36:02.560
Yeah.

03:36:02.560 --> 03:36:04.560
And I have seen an Alienware laptop now.

03:36:04.560 --> 03:36:07.560
I'm talking more like back when I was working at NCIX 10 years ago,

03:36:07.560 --> 03:36:11.560
you know, Alienware had 5,000, $6,000 laptops back then.

03:36:11.560 --> 03:36:14.560
And they were obviously, I mean, even the desktops, you know,

03:36:14.560 --> 03:36:17.560
I would look at it and I'd go, Alienware is a brand of computers.

03:36:17.560 --> 03:36:18.560
Obviously.

03:36:18.560 --> 03:36:21.560
Otherwise they wouldn't have a website, but I've never seen one.

03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:24.560
You know, I've never seen an actual game or gaming on one of these.

03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:25.560
And so it's the same thing.

03:36:25.560 --> 03:36:29.560
Like the SIM, the SIM setups, it's the kind of thing we build for

03:36:29.560 --> 03:36:32.560
spectacle or like dead mouse had one.

03:36:32.560 --> 03:36:35.560
But how many dead mouses are there in the world?

03:36:35.560 --> 03:36:42.560
People with the means, the space and the passion for gaming.

03:36:42.560 --> 03:36:45.560
They can't, they just can't be that many.

03:36:45.560 --> 03:36:49.560
Shraff and Floatplane Chat says in all caps, it's cheaper than

03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:51.560
actually hobby racing IRL.

03:36:51.560 --> 03:36:53.560
It's like, okay.

03:36:53.560 --> 03:36:55.560
Well, I wouldn't do that either.

03:36:55.560 --> 03:36:56.560
That sounds really expensive.

03:36:56.560 --> 03:36:57.560
Exactly.

03:36:57.560 --> 03:36:58.560
I'm consuming.

03:36:58.560 --> 03:37:04.560
I mean, yeah, I, and I, you know what?

03:37:04.560 --> 03:37:07.560
This is one of those things where I think I just have to acknowledge

03:37:07.560 --> 03:37:12.560
that as not a car enthusiast, I will never be able to put myself

03:37:12.560 --> 03:37:14.560
into the headspace of a car enthusiast.

03:37:14.560 --> 03:37:20.560
I mean, I know for a fact that Jake has relatively limited space

03:37:20.560 --> 03:37:22.560
compared to someone like dead mouse.

03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:23.560
Yeah.

03:37:23.560 --> 03:37:28.560
And he still feels it's a high enough priority to have a SIM racing

03:37:28.560 --> 03:37:30.560
setup in his computer room.

03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:31.560
Yes.

03:37:31.560 --> 03:37:32.560
Same for Ed.

03:37:32.560 --> 03:37:35.560
And they're extreme tech upgrades.

03:37:35.560 --> 03:37:39.560
So clearly it's a thing.

03:37:39.560 --> 03:37:42.560
But like $25,000 EK rig.

03:37:42.560 --> 03:37:45.560
Yeah, that seems outlandish.

03:37:45.560 --> 03:37:46.560
Yeah.

03:37:46.560 --> 03:37:48.560
Next up, we got to get through these.

03:37:48.560 --> 03:37:49.560
We got stuff to get to.

03:37:49.560 --> 03:37:50.560
Sorry, sorry.

03:37:50.560 --> 03:37:53.560
As a gun collector, that's entry level.

03:37:53.560 --> 03:37:55.560
I will never understand collecting.

03:37:55.560 --> 03:37:56.560
I'm sorry.

03:37:56.560 --> 03:37:57.560
I just don't think I will.

03:37:57.560 --> 03:37:59.560
My favorite comparison.

03:37:59.560 --> 03:38:01.560
You do some collecting.

03:38:01.560 --> 03:38:02.560
Sure.

03:38:02.560 --> 03:38:03.560
What do I collect?

03:38:03.560 --> 03:38:04.560
Controllers.

03:38:04.560 --> 03:38:05.560
Sort of.

03:38:05.560 --> 03:38:06.560
I use them all.

03:38:06.560 --> 03:38:08.560
My controller collection is like nine controllers.

03:38:08.560 --> 03:38:10.560
Like they actually are all in my daily.

03:38:10.560 --> 03:38:14.560
Yes, but you can't say that you didn't buy that like Xbox edition

03:38:14.560 --> 03:38:15.560
one.

03:38:15.560 --> 03:38:17.560
The prototype one.

03:38:17.560 --> 03:38:18.560
Right.

03:38:18.560 --> 03:38:19.560
But you do use it.

03:38:19.560 --> 03:38:20.560
Yeah.

03:38:20.560 --> 03:38:23.560
But you still bought it in what I would see as like a collector

03:38:23.560 --> 03:38:24.560
approach.

03:38:24.560 --> 03:38:26.560
Yeah, I guess that's true.

03:38:26.560 --> 03:38:30.560
When I said collection, I meant more in terms of like when I,

03:38:30.560 --> 03:38:32.560
when I, okay, when I heard gun collection, I was thinking like,

03:38:32.560 --> 03:38:36.560
okay, how many, how many guns can one person fire at once?

03:38:36.560 --> 03:38:40.560
My collector, my collector, my, my controller collection can

03:38:40.560 --> 03:38:43.560
all actually be used all at once.

03:38:43.560 --> 03:38:44.560
Like playing mage quit.

03:38:44.560 --> 03:38:46.560
I actually just need 10 controllers.

03:38:46.560 --> 03:38:49.560
So if I'm going to have to have 10 controllers,

03:38:49.560 --> 03:38:51.560
why would I buy all the same one?

03:38:51.560 --> 03:38:57.560
I don't consider that a collection.

03:38:57.560 --> 03:39:03.560
I have some very collectory unique item controllers.

03:39:03.560 --> 03:39:06.560
Do you appreciate unobtainium in things?

03:39:06.560 --> 03:39:07.560
I do.

03:39:07.560 --> 03:39:11.560
Which is not, it's not a hundred percent the same either.

03:39:11.560 --> 03:39:13.560
And like people are talking about my gold controller.

03:39:13.560 --> 03:39:15.560
I knew you were going to go, go there with this,

03:39:15.560 --> 03:39:17.560
but I wouldn't have done that.

03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:18.560
To make a video.

03:39:18.560 --> 03:39:19.560
Yeah, I wasn't going to.

03:39:19.560 --> 03:39:21.560
For that reason, I wasn't.

03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:23.560
Yeah.

03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:25.560
Yeah, people like to be frank, many collectors,

03:39:25.560 --> 03:39:27.560
item guns, you shouldn't fire for safety reasons.

03:39:27.560 --> 03:39:28.560
Yeah.

03:39:28.560 --> 03:39:30.560
Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.

03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:32.560
Yeah, that I don't understand.

03:39:32.560 --> 03:39:35.560
I also don't understand people that buy things with the purpose

03:39:35.560 --> 03:39:37.560
of leaving them in the box.

03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:39.560
I've never, I've never understood that at all.

03:39:39.560 --> 03:39:40.560
Okay.

03:39:40.560 --> 03:39:41.560
So Schrodinger's item.

03:39:41.560 --> 03:39:44.560
I need to talk to the community about this.

03:39:44.560 --> 03:39:46.560
Yeah, I know what you're going to say.

03:39:46.560 --> 03:39:47.560
Yeah.

03:39:47.560 --> 03:39:48.560
We have a sponsor.

03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:49.560
I'm not going to name them.

03:39:49.560 --> 03:39:50.560
You can guess.

03:39:50.560 --> 03:39:52.560
Are you able to create a poll?

03:39:52.560 --> 03:39:53.560
Yeah.

03:39:53.560 --> 03:39:57.560
We have a sponsor that wants to send us multiple,

03:39:57.560 --> 03:40:03.560
not one, but multiple sealed, clear,

03:40:03.560 --> 03:40:06.560
or like, like color, transparent addition,

03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:13.560
N64s to unbox all of them on short circuit.

03:40:13.560 --> 03:40:17.560
And I'm looking at it going.

03:40:17.560 --> 03:40:21.560
I think keep it simple.

03:40:21.560 --> 03:40:24.560
Just, uh, should we, is it cool or is it bad?

03:40:24.560 --> 03:40:26.560
And I'm looking at this going,

03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:30.560
I think people are going to be really angry about us breaking

03:40:30.560 --> 03:40:39.560
the seals on like five transparent and 64s.

03:40:39.560 --> 03:40:41.560
People are already on both sides of this.

03:40:41.560 --> 03:40:42.560
See, this is what I don't,

03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:45.560
I don't understand actually in this latest because like,

03:40:45.560 --> 03:40:46.560
what's the point?

03:40:46.560 --> 03:40:48.560
What's the point of leaving in the box?

03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:51.560
I almost think it's worse to leave in the box because then

03:40:51.560 --> 03:40:53.560
no one gets to enjoy it.

03:40:53.560 --> 03:40:55.560
All you get to enjoy is the external cardboard.

03:40:55.560 --> 03:40:58.560
And you could still enjoy that if you took it out of the box.

03:40:58.560 --> 03:41:00.560
Yeah, but it's just, it's one of those things like,

03:41:00.560 --> 03:41:02.560
I just don't get it from my point of view,

03:41:02.560 --> 03:41:06.560
even though I'm not a collector and I frankly just don't really

03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:07.560
get it.

03:41:07.560 --> 03:41:10.560
It's like, it's like taking some hollow foil,

03:41:10.560 --> 03:41:15.560
first print char, char, and just like ripping them up.

03:41:15.560 --> 03:41:16.560
Oh.

03:41:16.560 --> 03:41:18.560
Or like folding the corner because you're not,

03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:20.560
you're not ripping it out, but you're like,

03:41:20.560 --> 03:41:22.560
haha, I made this worth less.

03:41:22.560 --> 03:41:23.560
Watch me do it again.

03:41:23.560 --> 03:41:24.560
Haha, I did it again.

03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:27.560
I don't think that works because you could still play the game

03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:28.560
with it without doing that.

03:41:28.560 --> 03:41:30.560
But you could still play the, well,

03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:33.560
you can't play the N64.

03:41:33.560 --> 03:41:36.560
But we're, because you could like treat it nicely.

03:41:36.560 --> 03:41:43.560
No one's going to play TCG with a first edition hollow foil

03:41:43.560 --> 03:41:44.560
Charizard.

03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:45.560
I totally would.

03:41:45.560 --> 03:41:46.560
You're an idiot.

03:41:46.560 --> 03:41:48.560
But I wouldn't buy one.

03:41:48.560 --> 03:41:49.560
But like,

03:41:49.560 --> 03:41:51.560
And if I had one, I would sell it.

03:41:51.560 --> 03:41:56.560
Because I don't see the value in it, right?

03:41:56.560 --> 03:41:58.560
You know, I don't think you're an idiot.

03:41:58.560 --> 03:42:00.560
Well, no, because I would never be in that scenario

03:42:00.560 --> 03:42:02.560
because other people value it so much more

03:42:02.560 --> 03:42:05.560
that I would sell it immediately.

03:42:05.560 --> 03:42:06.560
So you're saying,

03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:07.560
So you're saying,

03:42:07.560 --> 03:42:10.560
I should take the N64s and I should sell them.

03:42:10.560 --> 03:42:13.560
I mean, if it was absolutely.

03:42:13.560 --> 03:42:16.560
Because if it's in my possession and I can't sell it,

03:42:16.560 --> 03:42:18.560
like, sure, I'm going to open it.

03:42:18.560 --> 03:42:21.560
Or if I have this hollow Charizard,

03:42:21.560 --> 03:42:23.560
but if I sell it, I go to jail.

03:42:23.560 --> 03:42:24.560
I don't care.

03:42:24.560 --> 03:42:26.560
I'm not going to just leave it on a shelf.

03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:29.560
That has literally genuinely zero value to me.

03:42:29.560 --> 03:42:31.560
I'm also probably not going to play the game with it

03:42:31.560 --> 03:42:33.560
because I also don't care about that.

03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:35.560
But I wouldn't mind,

03:42:35.560 --> 03:42:37.560
especially if it's in like a nice sleeve or whatever.

03:42:37.560 --> 03:42:39.560
Why do I care?

03:42:39.560 --> 03:42:42.560
The brand responded will send the bill to Yvonne.

03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:44.560
I think they misunderstood.

03:42:44.560 --> 03:42:47.560
I want them to pay to sponsor the funeral.

03:42:50.560 --> 03:42:53.560
I can't tell what these guys sometimes.

03:42:54.560 --> 03:42:55.560
All right.

03:42:55.560 --> 03:42:59.560
The poll seems pretty conclusive that it's cool.

03:42:59.560 --> 03:43:01.560
You apparently have,

03:43:01.560 --> 03:43:04.560
But those bads are going to be real mad.

03:43:04.560 --> 03:43:05.560
Oh, yeah.

03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:06.560
Yeah.

03:43:06.560 --> 03:43:07.560
Oh, yeah.

03:43:10.560 --> 03:43:11.560
Yeah.

03:43:11.560 --> 03:43:13.560
Like those are, those are some,

03:43:13.560 --> 03:43:18.560
I pretty much bet you the intensity of voting here is not equal.

03:43:18.560 --> 03:43:21.560
The people that are saying cool are like me, they don't care.

03:43:21.560 --> 03:43:22.560
It doesn't matter.

03:43:22.560 --> 03:43:25.560
They're not going to watch a video because you happened to open it.

03:43:25.560 --> 03:43:26.560
You know what I mean?

03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:31.560
The bads are going to be enraged because you happened to open it.

03:43:31.560 --> 03:43:33.560
Like these are, these are different things.

03:43:33.560 --> 03:43:36.560
Like I just don't value something remaining in a box.

03:43:36.560 --> 03:43:38.560
I don't value a car that doesn't get driven.

03:43:38.560 --> 03:43:41.560
I don't value a console that doesn't get played.

03:43:41.560 --> 03:43:45.560
Like I don't, I don't care about those things.

03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:48.560
So you're saying I'm allowed to buy an expensive car.

03:43:48.560 --> 03:43:51.560
He, he, he told me he was like worried about my,

03:43:51.560 --> 03:43:53.560
my soul or something like that.

03:43:53.560 --> 03:43:57.560
Like if I got to like into, you know, just luxury stuff,

03:43:57.560 --> 03:43:58.560
which is fair.

03:43:58.560 --> 03:44:00.560
So, but, but I'm allowed to buy an expensive car,

03:44:00.560 --> 03:44:04.560
which you don't seem to have a problem with as long as you get to drive it.

03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:06.560
You also didn't get the other one you were talking about.

03:44:06.560 --> 03:44:10.560
But if I had two and I can only drive one at once,

03:44:10.560 --> 03:44:11.560
is that a problem now?

03:44:11.560 --> 03:44:14.560
Well, no, it's not because if you drove them at all,

03:44:14.560 --> 03:44:16.560
because there's people that will,

03:44:16.560 --> 03:44:20.560
will acquire a car or the firearm in the previous conversation or a Pokemon

03:44:20.560 --> 03:44:23.560
card in the previous conversation or a console in this conversation

03:44:23.560 --> 03:44:26.560
and never, they will refute, they will leave it in the box.

03:44:26.560 --> 03:44:27.560
They'll never touch it.

03:44:27.560 --> 03:44:30.560
They'll be in like a climate controlled glass thing.

03:44:30.560 --> 03:44:33.560
And you're not even allowed within a foot of it, all this type of stuff.

03:44:33.560 --> 03:44:34.560
Well, what if it was a middle ground?

03:44:34.560 --> 03:44:38.560
What if I had two cars, a daily driver and one that I only drive on Sunday

03:44:38.560 --> 03:44:40.560
so that I can keep it in good condition?

03:44:40.560 --> 03:44:41.560
At least you drive it.

03:44:41.560 --> 03:44:42.560
At least you drive it.

03:44:42.560 --> 03:44:43.560
Okay.

03:44:43.560 --> 03:44:44.560
What if I had seven cars one for every day of the week?

03:44:44.560 --> 03:44:45.560
At least you drive it.

03:44:45.560 --> 03:44:46.560
That's literally not.

03:44:46.560 --> 03:44:48.560
So for you, it's just black and white for you.

03:44:48.560 --> 03:44:49.560
Pretty much.

03:44:49.560 --> 03:44:50.560
You should use the thing.

03:44:50.560 --> 03:44:53.560
So I'm allowed to have a Toyota Corolla GR then.

03:44:53.560 --> 03:44:54.560
Yes.

03:44:54.560 --> 03:44:55.560
Yeah.

03:44:55.560 --> 03:44:57.560
I love how excited.

03:44:57.560 --> 03:44:58.560
That's a sweet car.

03:44:58.560 --> 03:45:01.560
And like, you'd have to actually drive it though.

03:45:01.560 --> 03:45:02.560
That would be my.

03:45:02.560 --> 03:45:03.560
Well, I would drive it.

03:45:03.560 --> 03:45:04.560
Yeah.

03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:05.560
That thing looks freaking awesome.

03:45:05.560 --> 03:45:06.560
Yeah.

03:45:06.560 --> 03:45:07.560
Awesome.

03:45:07.560 --> 03:45:08.560
But you,

03:45:08.560 --> 03:45:09.560
you should enjoy it because it's cool to drive.

03:45:09.560 --> 03:45:10.560
Like the firearm example,

03:45:10.560 --> 03:45:12.560
like if you have this firearm that you keep in a safe,

03:45:12.560 --> 03:45:13.560
well,

03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:14.560
it's never allowed out.

03:45:14.560 --> 03:45:15.560
If you,

03:45:15.560 --> 03:45:16.560
if you shoot it on like special occasions,

03:45:16.560 --> 03:45:18.560
what I mean by the safe is like,

03:45:18.560 --> 03:45:19.560
you never even get to see it.

03:45:19.560 --> 03:45:20.560
Like,

03:45:20.560 --> 03:45:22.560
but if it's like a special occasions thing,

03:45:22.560 --> 03:45:23.560
like,

03:45:23.560 --> 03:45:26.560
even once a year,

03:45:26.560 --> 03:45:28.560
as long as it's used,

03:45:28.560 --> 03:45:30.560
it's like, all right, I don't, I don't mind that.

03:45:30.560 --> 03:45:31.560
But like it's,

03:45:31.560 --> 03:45:35.560
it feels notably bad to me to just be like,

03:45:35.560 --> 03:45:36.560
no,

03:45:36.560 --> 03:45:40.560
I'm going to keep this N64 and it's going to stay in a box forever.

03:45:40.560 --> 03:45:42.560
And I don't want it to ever be used.

03:45:42.560 --> 03:45:44.560
I don't want anyone to ever play a game on it.

03:45:44.560 --> 03:45:45.560
I don't want anyone to ever touch it.

03:45:45.560 --> 03:45:47.560
It's translucent, which is awesome,

03:45:47.560 --> 03:45:49.560
but it's going to stay in cardboard.

03:45:49.560 --> 03:45:50.560
So never,

03:45:50.560 --> 03:45:52.560
no one will ever see through this translucent plastic.

03:45:52.560 --> 03:45:53.560
Like,

03:45:53.560 --> 03:45:54.560
ah, that seems,

03:45:54.560 --> 03:45:55.560
that's rough to me.

03:45:55.560 --> 03:45:57.560
I actively don't like that,

03:45:57.560 --> 03:46:01.560
but the amount that I actively don't like that is very small.

03:46:01.560 --> 03:46:05.560
And the amount that people don't like it when you open those things is very big.

03:46:05.560 --> 03:46:07.560
Yeah.

03:46:07.560 --> 03:46:09.560
Everyone wants me to get the GR.

03:46:09.560 --> 03:46:10.560
Yes, please.

03:46:10.560 --> 03:46:11.560
It's a sweet car.

03:46:11.560 --> 03:46:15.560
Ah, I've been so close like twice and it just feels really stupid

03:46:15.560 --> 03:46:17.560
because I can only drive one car at once.

03:46:17.560 --> 03:46:18.560
I don't think you should actually.

03:46:18.560 --> 03:46:21.560
But then my Taycan's been in the shop for like almost six weeks.

03:46:21.560 --> 03:46:23.560
What if you sell a Taycan and get the GR?

03:46:23.560 --> 03:46:26.560
I'm not going to go back to going to gas stations all the time.

03:46:26.560 --> 03:46:27.560
Honestly,

03:46:27.560 --> 03:46:30.560
as stupid and trivial as it sounds,

03:46:30.560 --> 03:46:34.560
that is a huge part of the reason that I like driving an electric car.

03:46:34.560 --> 03:46:37.560
I hate refueling.

03:46:37.560 --> 03:46:39.560
I don't know if you should get it then.

03:46:39.560 --> 03:46:41.560
Take the Taycan powertrain.

03:46:41.560 --> 03:46:44.560
Maybe not the thing that you might think it would be.

03:46:44.560 --> 03:46:45.560
Sorry.

03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:46.560
Sorry.

03:46:46.560 --> 03:46:47.560
Yeah, go for it.

03:46:47.560 --> 03:46:49.560
Look at the massive delay, sorry.

03:46:49.560 --> 03:46:53.560
And my reason is because of a comment that you made not even that long ago,

03:46:54.560 --> 03:46:58.560
when you had to drive your old Volt.

03:46:58.560 --> 03:46:59.560
Yeah.

03:46:59.560 --> 03:47:00.560
Volt, right?

03:47:00.560 --> 03:47:01.560
Volt.

03:47:01.560 --> 03:47:02.560
Volt.

03:47:02.560 --> 03:47:04.560
You had to drive your old Volt again and you're like, yeah, I mean,

03:47:04.560 --> 03:47:05.560
it's really not that different.

03:47:05.560 --> 03:47:07.560
That's my reason why I don't think you should get it.

03:47:07.560 --> 03:47:08.560
The GR?

03:47:08.560 --> 03:47:10.560
Oh, the GR would be different.

03:47:10.560 --> 03:47:13.560
Would it be, would you actively actually enjoy it?

03:47:13.560 --> 03:47:15.560
It has a manual transmission.

03:47:15.560 --> 03:47:16.560
Oh, okay.

03:47:16.560 --> 03:47:17.560
Yeah.

03:47:17.560 --> 03:47:22.560
It's a three cylinder manual tranny like super lightweight just.

03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:23.560
That sounds fun.

03:47:23.560 --> 03:47:24.560
Like stupid.

03:47:24.560 --> 03:47:25.560
Would you track it?

03:47:25.560 --> 03:47:28.560
Um, I mean, he would track it for me.

03:47:28.560 --> 03:47:29.560
You'd track it for him?

03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:32.560
Oh, I mean, oh God, he'd probably, he'd probably.

03:47:32.560 --> 03:47:33.560
Can I go?

03:47:33.560 --> 03:47:34.560
Can I go?

03:47:34.560 --> 03:47:35.560
Can you drive me around?

03:47:35.560 --> 03:47:36.560
Can I go with you?

03:47:36.560 --> 03:47:37.560
You should, you should buy it.

03:47:37.560 --> 03:47:38.560
I'm going to type R though.

03:47:38.560 --> 03:47:39.560
You're getting a type R?

03:47:39.560 --> 03:47:40.560
Yeah.

03:47:40.560 --> 03:47:41.560
I have two deposits.

03:47:41.560 --> 03:47:42.560
Two deposits?

03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:43.560
Yeah.

03:47:43.560 --> 03:47:45.560
Are you going to scalp one so you can afford the other?

03:47:45.560 --> 03:47:46.560
Yeah.

03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:47.560
Okay.

03:47:47.560 --> 03:47:48.560
Sure.

03:47:48.560 --> 03:47:49.560
I'm not going to judge you.

03:47:49.560 --> 03:47:50.560
I don't care.

03:47:50.560 --> 03:47:51.560
Yeah.

03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:55.560
Andy's going type R.

03:47:55.560 --> 03:47:56.560
All right.

03:47:56.560 --> 03:47:59.560
Well, let's, let's keep going because we're, we're actually late.

03:47:59.560 --> 03:48:00.560
Oh yeah.

03:48:00.560 --> 03:48:01.560
Yeah.

03:48:01.560 --> 03:48:02.560
Like a lot of lunch.

03:48:02.560 --> 03:48:03.560
Yeah.

03:48:03.560 --> 03:48:04.560
Oh yeah.

03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:07.560
I'm sure they're flying out and stuff and the show's been on for almost

03:48:07.560 --> 03:48:08.560
four hours.

03:48:08.560 --> 03:48:09.560
We need to finish this.

03:48:09.560 --> 03:48:10.560
Yeah, let's go.

03:48:10.560 --> 03:48:11.560
Okay.

03:48:11.560 --> 03:48:13.560
If you guys want to go through potentials and respond to them,

03:48:13.560 --> 03:48:15.560
I'll start reading you the rest of the curated.

03:48:15.560 --> 03:48:17.560
I'll go for a lot of them are stuck for you.

03:48:17.560 --> 03:48:18.560
Oh, okay.

03:48:18.560 --> 03:48:19.560
I'm sure with this Taiwan trip,

03:48:19.560 --> 03:48:21.560
I've gotten to eat some great food.

03:48:21.560 --> 03:48:24.560
What are some set out foods or meals you have experienced in different

03:48:24.560 --> 03:48:27.560
countries?

03:48:27.560 --> 03:48:29.560
Buy a long shot.

03:48:29.560 --> 03:48:34.560
The best food I ever ate anywhere was on the Intel trip.

03:48:34.560 --> 03:48:38.560
I couldn't believe how good the food was there.

03:48:38.560 --> 03:48:40.560
Taiwan is really great too.

03:48:40.560 --> 03:48:44.560
I just meant I just love like just like comfort food here.

03:48:44.560 --> 03:48:47.560
Just like beef noodle soup went for like really good beef noodle soup

03:48:47.560 --> 03:48:48.560
last night.

03:48:48.560 --> 03:48:50.560
So good.

03:48:50.560 --> 03:48:52.560
My line is looking Dan.

03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:55.560
What has been the greatest challenge in your lifetimes to overcome?

03:48:55.560 --> 03:48:58.560
And how did you overcome it?

03:48:58.560 --> 03:48:59.560
Oh, wow.

03:48:59.560 --> 03:49:00.560
I just replied to that one.

03:49:00.560 --> 03:49:02.560
I think the obvious answer is kids, man.

03:49:02.560 --> 03:49:07.560
It's raising kids is the most challenging and important thing I will

03:49:07.560 --> 03:49:08.560
ever do.

03:49:08.560 --> 03:49:11.560
Are you doing curated or potential at the moment?

03:49:11.560 --> 03:49:12.560
Potentials.

03:49:12.560 --> 03:49:16.560
I'm going to start at the top of potentials.

03:49:16.560 --> 03:49:18.560
Okay.

03:49:18.560 --> 03:49:19.560
Okay.

03:49:19.560 --> 03:49:21.560
That one must have come down and pushed it.

03:49:21.560 --> 03:49:22.560
I see.

03:49:22.560 --> 03:49:24.560
What at Computex do you wish you could make?

03:49:24.560 --> 03:49:26.560
What the hell is going on?

03:49:26.560 --> 03:49:27.560
There's duplicates.

03:49:27.560 --> 03:49:32.560
Hi, LLD with your ongoing goal of making a badminton court complex.

03:49:32.560 --> 03:49:36.560
What other sports centers or storefronts would you like to try and open?

03:49:36.560 --> 03:49:43.560
I would like to see you open a PC or mobile phone repair shop.

03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:45.560
That's very unlikely to happen.

03:49:45.560 --> 03:49:50.560
I could see us doing like a gaming Airbnb or like a gaming hotel, but

03:49:50.560 --> 03:49:52.560
like in a more of like a Western style.

03:49:52.560 --> 03:49:56.560
I could see expanding the racket sport thing.

03:49:56.560 --> 03:50:01.560
I could see adding like squash and racket ball like tennis and like doing

03:50:01.560 --> 03:50:05.560
like a huge complex and I'm assuming I have unlimited money for this,

03:50:05.560 --> 03:50:06.560
which I don't.

03:50:06.560 --> 03:50:09.560
It's just going to be badminton and it's just going to be a small

03:50:09.560 --> 03:50:10.560
pro shop.

03:50:10.560 --> 03:50:14.560
But hey, if I'm imagining things, then that's what I would imagine.

03:50:15.560 --> 03:50:20.560
One of your rare 45 plus viewers, I retire in two and a half years and

03:50:20.560 --> 03:50:24.560
wonder if you would recommend a new career in tech at 50.

03:50:24.560 --> 03:50:26.560
And what would you point to?

03:50:29.560 --> 03:50:32.560
Well, we have a lot more 45 plus viewers than you would think.

03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:35.560
I can tell you that much already just based on people who walk up to me

03:50:35.560 --> 03:50:37.560
at trade shows and on the street.

03:50:37.560 --> 03:50:40.560
As for a new career in tech, man, that's tough.

03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:42.560
Tech is always moving so fast.

03:50:42.560 --> 03:50:49.560
The best thing is to just, you know, keep your ear to the ground and,

03:50:49.560 --> 03:50:51.560
you know, chase your passion, right?

03:50:51.560 --> 03:50:56.560
Like I, the billionaire that I was meeting with, I asked, you know,

03:50:56.560 --> 03:50:59.560
hey, well, you know, obviously I could probably look this up,

03:50:59.560 --> 03:51:01.560
but, you know, I'd love to hear it from you instead.

03:51:01.560 --> 03:51:02.560
You know, what's your story?

03:51:02.560 --> 03:51:07.560
And I was just so impressed by how passionate he was about what he

03:51:07.560 --> 03:51:08.560
was doing.

03:51:08.560 --> 03:51:09.560
And I just, I loved that.

03:51:09.560 --> 03:51:12.560
And it started with just trying to fix a simple problem,

03:51:12.560 --> 03:51:15.560
just identifying something that was a problem and, and,

03:51:15.560 --> 03:51:18.560
and building a solution for it that he was excited about.

03:51:18.560 --> 03:51:20.560
I just, I thought that was so cool.

03:51:20.560 --> 03:51:22.560
And I think that's just a great approach for everybody,

03:51:22.560 --> 03:51:25.560
whether you make a dollar or a billion dollars.

03:51:25.560 --> 03:51:29.560
If you can solve a problem, you're going to get satisfaction from it.

03:51:29.560 --> 03:51:31.560
And if you can solve a problem that a lot of people have,

03:51:31.560 --> 03:51:36.560
then, well, you're more likely to not make just a dollar.

03:51:39.560 --> 03:51:44.560
Gentlemen and Linus, I'm picking up the ABC book for my soon to be

03:51:44.560 --> 03:51:47.560
niece, looking forward to indoctrinating her.

03:51:47.560 --> 03:51:50.560
Everyone asks about parenting tips, but do you fellas have any

03:51:50.560 --> 03:51:52.560
uncleing tips?

03:51:55.560 --> 03:51:56.560
I don't know.

03:51:56.560 --> 03:51:57.560
I feel like it's pretty easy.

03:51:57.560 --> 03:51:59.560
You're more of an uncle than me.

03:51:59.560 --> 03:52:00.560
I literally am.

03:52:00.560 --> 03:52:03.560
I actually, I actually had enough unis.

03:52:03.560 --> 03:52:04.560
Okay. Yeah.

03:52:04.560 --> 03:52:06.560
I mean, you have the easy job, right?

03:52:06.560 --> 03:52:08.560
You get to swoop in when it's fun and hang out.

03:52:08.560 --> 03:52:10.560
And then when things suck, you get to leave.

03:52:10.560 --> 03:52:12.560
So it's like, I don't know.

03:52:12.560 --> 03:52:18.560
I haven't been one of kids that are old enough to really do a

03:52:18.560 --> 03:52:21.560
lot of the things that I think uncles would be best at doing.

03:52:21.560 --> 03:52:25.560
But the things that I'm prepared and excited to do is like be very

03:52:25.560 --> 03:52:26.560
present.

03:52:26.560 --> 03:52:31.560
Like when, when my brother's daughter grows up, I'm sure she

03:52:31.560 --> 03:52:35.560
will be involved in some type of activity.

03:52:35.560 --> 03:52:39.560
I don't know whether it's a sport or something else, but I would

03:52:39.560 --> 03:52:42.560
like to, to be there and support.

03:52:44.560 --> 03:52:45.560
Yeah.

03:52:45.560 --> 03:52:46.560
I don't know.

03:52:46.560 --> 03:52:51.560
Try to help with like opportunity enablement as much as

03:52:51.560 --> 03:52:52.560
possible.

03:52:52.560 --> 03:52:56.560
If, if my brother and his wife are busy, try to help stuff like

03:52:56.560 --> 03:52:57.560
that.

03:52:57.560 --> 03:52:59.560
I just treat my nephew and niece like I would my kids.

03:52:59.560 --> 03:53:03.560
I firmly believe that, you know, kids need structure.

03:53:03.560 --> 03:53:06.560
And I think just being the fun uncle is not necessarily a good

03:53:06.560 --> 03:53:07.560
play.

03:53:07.560 --> 03:53:10.560
I want to be the, the uncle that gave them good advice and told

03:53:10.560 --> 03:53:14.560
them the right things and, you know, checked them when they were,

03:53:14.560 --> 03:53:18.560
when they were doing something that was going to cause problems.

03:53:19.560 --> 03:53:20.560
Yeah.

03:53:20.560 --> 03:53:23.560
I just, I just uncle exactly the same as I parent.

03:53:23.560 --> 03:53:24.560
That's true.

03:53:24.560 --> 03:53:26.560
I feel the same way about like dogs and stuff too.

03:53:26.560 --> 03:53:27.560
It's the same thing.

03:53:27.560 --> 03:53:29.560
I just, you're not going to be there all the time.

03:53:29.560 --> 03:53:34.560
So I think something that gets lost on a lot of people in that

03:53:34.560 --> 03:53:38.560
situation is that the kids still value you being there, even though

03:53:38.560 --> 03:53:40.560
you're not their direct parents.

03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:41.560
So you shouldn't forget that.

03:53:41.560 --> 03:53:42.560
You should actually be there.

03:53:42.560 --> 03:53:44.560
And they like notice when you're not there.

03:53:44.560 --> 03:53:45.560
So yeah.

03:53:46.560 --> 03:53:48.560
Linus, you've mentioned your socks before.

03:53:48.560 --> 03:53:51.560
What are your favorite configs for your daily socks?

03:53:52.560 --> 03:53:55.560
I only wear one sock.

03:53:55.560 --> 03:53:59.560
Well, unless I'm trialing prototypes of the socks that we're

03:53:59.560 --> 03:54:00.560
trying to make.

03:54:00.560 --> 03:54:03.560
And they're just darn toughs, regular like crew sock.

03:54:03.560 --> 03:54:05.560
I actually was on their site the other day because someone asked

03:54:05.560 --> 03:54:06.560
me about this.

03:54:06.560 --> 03:54:10.560
And I didn't see the exact model that I have anymore, but they're,

03:54:10.560 --> 03:54:11.560
they're just so good.

03:54:11.560 --> 03:54:12.560
Merino wool.

03:54:12.560 --> 03:54:15.560
They're the reason that we haven't made a sock yet because I

03:54:15.560 --> 03:54:17.560
can't beat them or match them.

03:54:18.560 --> 03:54:21.560
If we can even get like 95% of the way there, I'll consider that

03:54:21.560 --> 03:54:23.560
good enough, but we can't yet.

03:54:24.560 --> 03:54:26.560
Last of mine curated.

03:54:26.560 --> 03:54:27.560
Hey DLL.

03:54:27.560 --> 03:54:31.560
How important is it for you to not be recognized in public when

03:54:31.560 --> 03:54:33.560
you just want to enjoy something else?

03:54:33.560 --> 03:54:35.560
Now you guys are famous.

03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:37.560
Greetings from Germany.

03:54:37.560 --> 03:54:38.560
I give up.

03:54:39.560 --> 03:54:42.560
Just, yeah, there was a, there was a video that came up recently

03:54:42.560 --> 03:54:48.560
of some, some dude streaming, riding a bike in Norway or

03:54:48.560 --> 03:54:49.560
something.

03:54:49.560 --> 03:54:53.560
And he, he goes past Magnus Carlson who's sitting on a

03:54:53.560 --> 03:54:55.560
bench watching something on his phone.

03:54:55.560 --> 03:54:58.560
And the guy asked for a selfie from Magnus.

03:54:58.560 --> 03:55:02.560
The Magnus is like, first of all, tell some like, sorry, I don't

03:55:02.560 --> 03:55:03.560
want to be bothered.

03:55:03.560 --> 03:55:05.560
And then the guy talks to him anyways.

03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:08.560
And then he goes, could I like get a selfie with you after I

03:55:08.560 --> 03:55:09.560
watched this thing?

03:55:09.560 --> 03:55:11.560
And the guy's like, no, I'm in a hurry right now.

03:55:11.560 --> 03:55:12.560
I need it right now.

03:55:12.560 --> 03:55:13.560
And it gets really pushy.

03:55:13.560 --> 03:55:16.560
And then Magnus like, goes to take the photo with them.

03:55:16.560 --> 03:55:19.560
And then the guy asked for Magnus to stand up for the photo.

03:55:19.560 --> 03:55:23.560
And you can tell that Magnus is like really annoyed, but just

03:55:23.560 --> 03:55:24.560
doing it anyways.

03:55:24.560 --> 03:55:26.560
And like the, the dude's streaming this whole time.

03:55:26.560 --> 03:55:28.560
So now this interaction is on camera.

03:55:28.560 --> 03:55:31.560
And it's just like, oh man, stuff like that's really rough.

03:55:31.560 --> 03:55:36.560
I am, I always prefer that people like say hi.

03:55:36.560 --> 03:55:40.560
Cause I would always rather know that you recognize me than

03:55:40.560 --> 03:55:43.560
sit there and like wonder if people around me know who I am.

03:55:43.560 --> 03:55:45.560
But I know that's not true for everyone.

03:55:45.560 --> 03:55:47.560
It's going to be slightly different for everybody,

03:55:47.560 --> 03:55:49.560
which is like a knowing, but it is.

03:55:49.560 --> 03:55:53.560
So excited to get the 3d down jacket just in time for 90

03:55:53.560 --> 03:55:54.560
degree Fahrenheit.

03:55:54.560 --> 03:55:55.560
Oh crap.

03:55:55.560 --> 03:55:56.560
I know what that sound is.

03:55:56.560 --> 03:55:57.560
Read this one.

03:55:57.560 --> 03:55:58.560
The alarm's going up.

03:55:58.560 --> 03:55:59.560
Uh,

03:55:59.560 --> 03:56:00.560
He's trying to get my attention.

03:56:00.560 --> 03:56:01.560
It is loud beeping.

03:56:01.560 --> 03:56:02.560
Sorry guys.

03:56:02.560 --> 03:56:03.560
So excited for my 3d down jacket.

03:56:03.560 --> 03:56:04.560
I'm excited.

03:56:04.560 --> 03:56:05.560
I'm excited.

03:56:05.560 --> 03:56:06.560
I'm excited.

03:56:06.560 --> 03:56:07.560
I'm excited.

03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:08.560
I'm excited.

03:56:08.560 --> 03:56:09.560
I'm excited.

03:56:09.560 --> 03:56:10.560
I'm excited.

03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:11.560
I'm excited.

03:56:11.560 --> 03:56:12.560
I'm excited.

03:56:12.560 --> 03:56:13.560
I'm excited.

03:56:13.560 --> 03:56:14.560
I'm excited.

03:56:14.560 --> 03:56:15.560
I'm excited.

03:56:15.560 --> 03:56:16.560
I'm excited.

03:56:16.560 --> 03:56:17.560
I'm excited.

03:56:17.560 --> 03:56:18.560
I'm excited.

03:56:18.560 --> 03:56:19.560
I'm excited.

03:56:19.560 --> 03:56:20.560
I'm excited.

03:56:20.560 --> 03:56:21.560
I'm excited.

03:56:21.560 --> 03:56:22.560
I'm excited.

03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:23.560
I'm excited.

03:56:23.560 --> 03:56:24.560
I'm excited.

03:56:24.560 --> 03:56:25.560
I'm excited.

03:56:25.560 --> 03:56:26.560
I'm excited.

03:56:26.560 --> 03:56:27.560
I'm excited.

03:56:27.560 --> 03:56:28.560
I'm excited.

03:56:28.560 --> 03:56:29.560
I'm excited.

03:56:29.560 --> 03:56:32.560
I'm excited for my 3d down jacket for 90 Fahrenheit

03:56:32.560 --> 03:56:33.560
weather.

03:56:33.560 --> 03:56:35.560
That's hot for the Celsius folks out there.

03:56:35.560 --> 03:56:38.560
I can't wait for the LCT bro tank in December.

03:56:38.560 --> 03:56:39.560
Linus.

03:56:39.560 --> 03:56:43.560
What's the first home project you ever did and how did it go?

03:56:43.560 --> 03:56:47.560
I assume you mean when I moved into my place.

03:56:47.560 --> 03:56:48.560
Yeah.

03:56:48.560 --> 03:56:50.560
When I moved into my place.

03:56:50.560 --> 03:56:55.560
I was kind of home DIY things that I did was actually on video

03:56:55.560 --> 03:56:56.560
though.

03:56:56.560 --> 03:57:00.560
I ran an ethernet cable along the outside of the house to where

03:57:00.560 --> 03:57:02.560
the media PC is.

03:57:02.560 --> 03:57:06.560
And I had a contractor help me, but I actually did do some of the

03:57:06.560 --> 03:57:07.560
work myself as well.

03:57:07.560 --> 03:57:09.560
And I made a video about it.

03:57:09.560 --> 03:57:15.560
For me, like networking is the first thing that needs to be

03:57:15.560 --> 03:57:16.560
done.

03:57:16.560 --> 03:57:21.560
I didn't, did I do that much handy stuff?

03:57:21.560 --> 03:57:22.560
Yeah.

03:57:22.560 --> 03:57:24.560
I guess I started doing it a lot later.

03:57:24.560 --> 03:57:27.560
Like I don't count painting the nursery when we had kids.

03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:31.560
Is that a home project?

03:57:31.560 --> 03:57:32.560
Yeah.

03:57:32.560 --> 03:57:34.560
How did they define it?

03:57:34.560 --> 03:57:36.560
What's the first home project you ever did?

03:57:36.560 --> 03:57:37.560
Yeah.

03:57:37.560 --> 03:57:38.560
That went well.

03:57:38.560 --> 03:57:42.560
I mean, I also painted all the furniture for the nursery, painted

03:57:42.560 --> 03:57:43.560
it white.

03:57:43.560 --> 03:57:47.560
So we had this kind of fun kind of pastel yellow and white

03:57:47.560 --> 03:57:52.560
color scheme in there.

03:57:52.560 --> 03:57:58.560
Man, it's amazing the things you forget.

03:57:58.560 --> 03:58:00.560
Yeah, I'm going to go with that.

03:58:00.560 --> 03:58:02.560
I did that.

03:58:02.560 --> 03:58:03.560
Okay.

03:58:03.560 --> 03:58:05.560
The police aren't on their way.

03:58:05.560 --> 03:58:06.560
Thankfully.

03:58:06.560 --> 03:58:08.560
Let's see what we got here.

03:58:08.560 --> 03:58:11.560
Linus, assuming in your new position, you will get a modicum of

03:58:11.560 --> 03:58:12.560
more free time.

03:58:12.560 --> 03:58:17.560
What kind of things are you going to pick up in this free time?

03:58:17.560 --> 03:58:19.560
More hosting.

03:58:19.560 --> 03:58:20.560
More coaching.

03:58:20.560 --> 03:58:23.560
I want to do more coaching for our hosts and our shooters and,

03:58:23.560 --> 03:58:27.560
you know, help make sure that our, everything we upload is,

03:58:27.560 --> 03:58:32.560
is LMGE.

03:58:32.560 --> 03:58:35.560
I hear that there are new firmware updates on the ally.

03:58:35.560 --> 03:58:41.560
Have you noticed any improvements that others have not?

03:58:42.560 --> 03:58:46.560
No.

03:58:46.560 --> 03:58:51.560
I can respond to this other one at the same time from Joshua as

03:58:51.560 --> 03:58:54.560
responding to how Tears of the Kingdom has been on the allies so

03:58:54.560 --> 03:58:55.560
far.

03:58:55.560 --> 03:58:57.560
It's been, oh, I've got a couple of these.

03:58:57.560 --> 03:58:59.560
Raven also asked how Tears of the Kingdom on the ally.

03:58:59.560 --> 03:59:02.560
The performance I'm getting is not great right now, but I've got

03:59:02.560 --> 03:59:03.560
to be honest with you.

03:59:03.560 --> 03:59:06.560
The only time I had to play it was on the plane.

03:59:06.560 --> 03:59:10.560
And other than loading all the files onto it ahead of time, I

03:59:10.560 --> 03:59:12.560
didn't really research anything.

03:59:12.560 --> 03:59:15.560
So I was kind of trying to figure it out on my own on the plane.

03:59:15.560 --> 03:59:20.560
I tried to apply a 60 FPS mod and it seemed to make performance

03:59:20.560 --> 03:59:21.560
worse.

03:59:21.560 --> 03:59:23.560
Though I wasn't really sure.

03:59:23.560 --> 03:59:26.560
Performance seemed lower than it should have been because Breath of

03:59:26.560 --> 03:59:29.560
the Wild runs amazing on it.

03:59:29.560 --> 03:59:31.560
And I wasn't really expecting Tears of the Kingdom performance to

03:59:31.560 --> 03:59:34.560
be that much lower than Breath of the Wild, given that they don't

03:59:34.560 --> 03:59:36.560
seem to work out their front to me.

03:59:36.560 --> 03:59:39.560
I, you know, could have missed something though.

03:59:39.560 --> 03:59:42.560
And I'm not just talking like when it's compiling shape.

03:59:42.560 --> 03:59:45.560
This is really not working very well.

03:59:45.560 --> 03:59:47.560
I'm not just talking when it's compiling shaders.

03:59:47.560 --> 03:59:50.560
I mean, just in general, performance seemed pretty rubbish,

03:59:50.560 --> 03:59:52.560
actually.

03:59:52.560 --> 03:59:56.560
And it would kind of start lagging more sometimes, too.

03:59:56.560 --> 03:59:59.560
So it hasn't been a great experience so far in Tears of the

03:59:59.560 --> 04:00:03.560
Kingdom, but it ran Breath of the Wild great.

04:00:03.560 --> 04:00:06.560
But I was using CMU for Breath of the Wild, and I'm using Yuzu

04:00:06.560 --> 04:00:08.560
for Tears of the Kingdom, and I'm new to Yuzu.

04:00:08.560 --> 04:00:11.560
I have spent almost no time with it.

04:00:11.560 --> 04:00:14.560
I don't really know the ins and outs.

04:00:14.560 --> 04:00:19.560
So I forget what the original question was, but no, I probably

04:00:19.560 --> 04:00:23.560
haven't noticed things that other people haven't yet because I

04:00:23.560 --> 04:00:32.560
haven't really had much time to game in the last couple of weeks.

04:00:32.560 --> 04:00:35.560
Archive.

04:00:35.560 --> 04:00:37.560
Hi, Linus, do you carry any skills from your product manager

04:00:37.560 --> 04:00:38.560
days into your day-to-day life?

04:00:38.560 --> 04:00:39.560
Absolutely.

04:00:39.560 --> 04:00:41.560
I mean, everything you do, every person you meet is an

04:00:41.560 --> 04:00:43.560
opportunity to learn.

04:00:43.560 --> 04:00:47.560
And I think that's something that I do a relatively good job of,

04:00:47.560 --> 04:00:51.560
just keeping my eyes open and trying to understand better.

04:00:51.560 --> 04:00:56.560
I actually got some very high praise that made me really

04:00:56.560 --> 04:01:01.560
happy when we were working on our framework factory tour,

04:01:01.560 --> 04:01:04.560
which is coming.

04:01:04.560 --> 04:01:08.560
One of the higher-ups at Framework used to work in

04:01:08.560 --> 04:01:13.560
like supply chain for Apple and said that when I did my

04:01:13.560 --> 04:01:16.560
original framework video explaining why a company needs

04:01:16.560 --> 04:01:19.560
investment and sort of explaining how the supply chain

04:01:19.560 --> 04:01:24.560
works, that I got it like 85% to 90% right to the point.

04:01:24.560 --> 04:01:29.560
And like the parts that were not that were not wrong,

04:01:29.560 --> 04:01:32.560
they were just like maybe not as thorough.

04:01:33.560 --> 04:01:35.560
But she's like super sharp.

04:01:35.560 --> 04:01:39.560
And so whenever someone gives me praise,

04:01:39.560 --> 04:01:41.560
I always consider the source.

04:01:41.560 --> 04:01:44.560
So I appreciated her saying that because she seems like a

04:01:44.560 --> 04:01:47.560
shark.

04:01:47.560 --> 04:01:50.560
And she said, yeah, you got like 85%, 90% right.

04:01:50.560 --> 04:01:52.560
And I'm kind of sitting here going,

04:01:52.560 --> 04:01:55.560
how does anyone in the media have any business like knowing

04:01:55.560 --> 04:01:57.560
this much about supply chain?

04:01:57.560 --> 04:01:59.560
Because I've just never really seen that before.

04:01:59.560 --> 04:02:01.560
And yeah, it's just stuff that I've picked up from my

04:02:01.560 --> 04:02:04.560
product management days and from just kind of trying to

04:02:04.560 --> 04:02:06.560
pay attention, try to understand better.

04:02:06.560 --> 04:02:09.560
The intro for that video is really funny.

04:02:09.560 --> 04:02:12.560
I think I wrote it.

04:02:12.560 --> 04:02:15.560
But basically I'm walking down the streets and I pay and I

04:02:15.560 --> 04:02:18.560
go, you know, yeah, PlayStation 5,

04:02:18.560 --> 04:02:22.560
toilet paper, framework laptops.

04:02:22.560 --> 04:02:25.560
I want to buy one, but if it's not in stock,

04:02:25.560 --> 04:02:26.560
what's the deal with that?

04:02:26.560 --> 04:02:28.560
Why don't they just make more of them?

04:02:28.560 --> 04:02:32.560
And I have ample reason to be angry about the six,

04:02:32.560 --> 04:02:35.560
there's a six month wait right now for the AMD version of the

04:02:35.560 --> 04:02:37.560
framework.

04:02:37.560 --> 04:02:42.560
So I have ample reason to be mad about this because aside from

04:02:42.560 --> 04:02:44.560
just waiting six months for my laptop,

04:02:44.560 --> 04:02:47.560
I have a lot of money riding on them being able to deliver

04:02:47.560 --> 04:02:49.560
freaking product.

04:02:49.560 --> 04:02:51.560
So why aren't they just making more?

04:02:51.560 --> 04:02:53.560
Since I'm in Taiwan anyway, I thought I'm going to knock on

04:02:53.560 --> 04:02:55.560
some doors and figure out what the heck's going on with my

04:02:55.560 --> 04:02:57.560
investment.

04:02:57.560 --> 04:02:59.560
And then this is amazing.

04:02:59.560 --> 04:03:01.560
And I'm sorry to kind of ruin the joke for you guys because

04:03:01.560 --> 04:03:03.560
it'll be really funny if you don't have it ruined.

04:03:03.560 --> 04:03:09.560
But anyway, it cuts straight from there to me in this like

04:03:09.560 --> 04:03:14.560
shanty, like back alley, because when you search for

04:03:14.560 --> 04:03:16.560
framework, they have an office here,

04:03:16.560 --> 04:03:18.560
but when you search for framework on Google Maps,

04:03:18.560 --> 04:03:21.560
it takes you to some, it's labeled bicycle club,

04:03:21.560 --> 04:03:26.560
but it seems to be like a bus repair garage or something.

04:03:26.560 --> 04:03:30.560
And so I'm just standing and we actually went to the trouble to

04:03:30.560 --> 04:03:34.560
drive half an hour out of our way to go be at framework

04:03:34.560 --> 04:03:36.560
bicycle club in Taiwan.

04:03:36.560 --> 04:03:39.560
And I'm like, there's a bicycle club.

04:03:39.560 --> 04:03:41.560
Did I just get played?

04:03:41.560 --> 04:03:46.560
And then it hard cuts to the compile factory where frameworks

04:03:46.560 --> 04:03:49.560
are made and gets into the framework,

04:03:49.560 --> 04:03:52.560
the framework tour, which is going to be really, really exciting.

04:03:52.560 --> 04:03:55.560
I've never been in a laptop manufacturing facility.

04:03:55.560 --> 04:03:57.560
I don't think compiles ever done anything like that before.

04:03:57.560 --> 04:03:59.560
It's going to be really cool.

04:03:59.560 --> 04:04:01.560
And I think that's it for the WAN show.

04:04:01.560 --> 04:04:02.560
That is it.

04:04:02.560 --> 04:04:03.560
We'll see you again next week.

04:04:03.560 --> 04:04:04.560
Same bad time.

04:04:04.560 --> 04:04:05.560
Same bad channel.

04:04:05.560 --> 04:04:06.560
Bye.

04:04:06.560 --> 04:04:07.560
A little different time.

04:04:07.560 --> 04:04:08.560
This is an earlier time.

04:04:08.560 --> 04:04:09.560
Yeah.

04:04:25.560 --> 04:04:26.560
Yeah.
