WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.480
We're live live wait, we're not live on YouTube this time again. Are we are you sure how'd that happen anyway? Yeah

00:14.080 --> 00:16.080
So two weeks before

00:16.880 --> 00:22.480
We should we're live on YouTube. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I monitor it too. You can't get me with that

00:24.480 --> 00:29.680
Yeah, a couple weeks before the the Google stream remember we had that same issue with the test stream

00:30.240 --> 00:34.720
And so we added it to v mix as a secondary destination, but we didn't turn it off. We didn't turn it off. Oh sick

00:35.120 --> 00:37.360
Yeah, so now I turned it off cool

00:38.160 --> 00:40.160
I still think we should disable the

00:40.160 --> 00:42.160
Go live immediately on YouTube

00:42.560 --> 00:44.800
Um, but I still have to test it

00:45.600 --> 00:47.840
Yeah, I mean, I don't remember why

00:48.400 --> 00:52.880
But I we had there was a reason. Yeah, there was a reason we did it this way. I've been trying to

00:53.520 --> 00:57.600
Think on it a little bit. I don't remember the reason was but there was one we did it a long time ago

00:57.840 --> 00:59.840
We made that change and I

01:00.320 --> 01:02.800
It was there was a very good reason. Yeah

01:03.440 --> 01:05.280
Like it was disastrous the other way

01:05.360 --> 01:06.880
I can't remember why though

01:06.880 --> 01:12.880
Me neither because like the stream doesn't end when the encoding feed stops and you have to remember to manually stop it

01:12.960 --> 01:16.880
Like I don't know something wacky. There's stuff. There's stuff

01:17.760 --> 01:22.480
Um, I it's not stopping. I put the phone very far away. Is it me for a change?

01:22.880 --> 01:29.760
Maybe maybe oh, it's me today. You know what it probably is

01:30.480 --> 01:33.360
My phone does it too, but I'm not popular

01:34.960 --> 01:36.960
So I'm just not getting messages all the time

01:36.960 --> 01:41.600
I suspect you get a lot of messages during the show as well. I meant to ask is it texts?

01:41.920 --> 01:44.640
Are you guys getting texts? Or is it just like

01:45.600 --> 01:47.600
instant messages on other apps

01:48.960 --> 01:51.680
I haven't gotten a text today probably I

01:52.720 --> 01:54.720
Not a very popular person going

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, like is that coming through?

01:59.840 --> 02:02.560
I find it very annoying personally. What if I just like?

02:05.440 --> 02:07.440
Luke's phone about to get yote

02:09.760 --> 02:11.760
We good

02:12.160 --> 02:17.200
Is it actively getting worse? We got to put that thing in the rf chamber. I want to know what the hell's going on with that

02:17.280 --> 02:19.280
We really do need to do that

02:19.760 --> 02:21.760
I have never heard one that bad

02:21.920 --> 02:27.760
Like if you have a phone like within three inches of room a microphone normally you have problems, but this is this is insane

02:28.560 --> 02:34.240
Because normally normally I get it under the desk and I remove line of sight from like all of this stuff

02:34.240 --> 02:37.200
So there's wooden table in the way and everything and then it's fine

02:37.920 --> 02:39.920
But now I had to put it like across the room

02:40.800 --> 02:42.160
sick

02:42.160 --> 02:44.160
Hopefully no one needs to contact you

02:44.960 --> 02:50.560
Okay, we're gonna do this thing. Yeah, that is a bit of a concern, but we'll figure it out. Uh, yeah

02:53.760 --> 02:55.760
Um

02:56.480 --> 02:58.480
Okay, hold on

03:14.160 --> 03:16.160
Um

03:34.080 --> 03:36.080
Okay

03:37.280 --> 03:39.280
Uh

03:44.400 --> 03:46.400
Okay

03:51.920 --> 03:52.960
Oh

03:52.960 --> 03:58.240
I do want to uh, talk about the overwatch two thing. Have you paid attention to that all this week? It's not docked, but

03:59.360 --> 04:01.360
Are you interested in it at all? Um

04:02.640 --> 04:07.920
I'm mad so maybe that counts. Yeah, maybe huck that up as like, uh, sure a potential

04:07.920 --> 04:09.920
I

04:13.440 --> 04:15.440
Feel like we won't need it today, but

04:15.760 --> 04:20.800
I'll throw it out there just in case I'm quite interested in google paying for deceptive advertising

04:21.120 --> 04:23.360
Paying radio hosts to a hypophone. They hadn't used

04:24.080 --> 04:26.560
I hadn't actually seen this. Um

04:27.680 --> 04:33.280
I could I could talk a fair bit about influencers like that. I know don't use things. Um

04:34.800 --> 04:36.800
Hyping them

04:38.880 --> 04:40.880
I

04:43.840 --> 04:45.840
Actually, I can think of one time that I did it too

04:46.960 --> 04:51.680
I read the stupid raid shadow legends copy and I was just like I was honestly just memeing

04:52.160 --> 04:54.720
I was like, yeah, my favorite heroes, whatever like what

04:55.920 --> 04:58.080
And I was and some people were not like

04:58.960 --> 05:04.400
Yeah, I know no one actually plays this game and like felt like upset about it. Yeah fair enough

05:04.400 --> 05:07.440
My favorite here is gorgonotron. You should just like made something up

05:13.120 --> 05:16.320
Okay, do you want to throw that one up as well just in case? Um

05:19.920 --> 05:26.640
So what oh people not actually using devices that they're reporting on? Uh, yeah, or that they are paid to endorse got it

05:30.960 --> 05:32.960
Something is moving the dock around a lot

05:35.280 --> 05:37.280
You

05:56.800 --> 05:58.800
Okay

06:04.640 --> 06:06.640
Oh

06:09.760 --> 06:15.520
Wow, there's apparently like a nerd fight going on over like the asus motherboard thing

06:17.600 --> 06:20.560
Hard one box managed to get someone to delete their twitter account

06:21.920 --> 06:23.920
Okay, I love it

06:25.520 --> 06:27.120
Drama

06:27.120 --> 06:28.640
Okay

06:28.640 --> 06:31.520
Ultra drama. All right, you know what let's just do this thing

06:32.480 --> 06:39.120
Do you want to throw the do you want to throw nerd drama in as one more alternative thing that we can just go discover in real time during the show

06:39.360 --> 06:41.360
Sure. All right

06:45.680 --> 06:50.000
Oh, where's my float plane chat? Oh, here we go. Well, there's your problem

06:52.640 --> 06:54.640
You know, I think

06:55.840 --> 06:59.760
Based on how my tummy's going there may be something decomposing in my insides

07:02.480 --> 07:05.680
I think that's relatively normal. That's fair

07:11.680 --> 07:13.840
Uh, yeah, stick locks should work with the inio next

07:20.240 --> 07:22.240
Um

07:22.320 --> 07:27.360
Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh shoot. We don't have the stupid asus router issue in here, do we?

07:28.960 --> 07:30.960
crap

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Okay, that's a problem

07:37.440 --> 07:43.200
When it rains it pours for asus. Yeah, no, I mean it's a problem that we don't have it in here

07:50.240 --> 07:55.680
Oh, wow, it's just like not even in the potential topics. Uh, okay

07:58.560 --> 08:00.560
One second

08:02.480 --> 08:06.480
I saw the headlines about this but I haven't actually read anything about it

08:18.880 --> 08:26.880
Bosch desus update kicks routers offline worldwide company apologizes a faulty ai protection definition update is the suspected culprit

08:27.600 --> 08:29.200
Oh, okay

08:29.200 --> 08:31.200
I have a link. Where's our

08:31.600 --> 08:37.360
Where's our potential? Here we go bottom of the main area. I mean, it's like a reddit link. So whatever but I have a tom's link

08:37.360 --> 08:39.360
I'll throw it in there as well. Sure

08:39.360 --> 08:41.440
Why would you take tom's link?

08:41.440 --> 08:43.600
That's tom's link luke stolen

08:44.880 --> 08:47.760
Or should I say privateered got him

08:51.360 --> 08:57.280
Okay, yeah, uh, let's punch it. Oh wait. I'm the one who does that anyway, aren't I okay? I'm doing it. I'm resuming the selected

08:57.920 --> 08:59.920
You guys ready? Yes

09:02.480 --> 09:04.480
You

09:25.280 --> 09:28.640
What is up everyone and welcome to the wind show

09:29.600 --> 09:33.600
We have a fantastic show lined up for you today a lot of great topics

09:33.680 --> 09:36.480
I'm going to do my best to pick the two that luke was planning on

09:37.040 --> 09:43.040
Uh, schools are struggling with ai as the academic year ends. Oh crap failure so far. Uh,

09:43.840 --> 09:45.040
and

09:45.040 --> 09:46.240
uh

09:46.240 --> 09:51.520
A startup is offering free televisions as long as you consent to being spied on

09:52.000 --> 09:56.080
You got 50 percent. Uh, this guy uh stepped down as CEO

09:56.800 --> 09:58.320
That's a topic

09:58.880 --> 10:05.840
I gotta farm you for content chief vision officer would agree that you should be farmed for content. Okay, that's I I

10:06.560 --> 10:08.560
I believe that's how that would go

10:08.640 --> 10:10.000
Ah

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Man, yep

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
um

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Imager content

10:28.880 --> 10:41.280
The show is brought to you today by zoho one brilliant and kudos

10:41.920 --> 10:45.280
Uh, why don't we jump into our first big topic?

10:45.360 --> 10:49.600
You know what? I haven't actually done a q&a with the float plane peeps yet

10:49.680 --> 10:54.080
But I guess they can ask me some questions now. I'll I'll do a stream a little bit later with you guys

10:54.240 --> 10:58.240
I did say I would do that in the video, but in summary if you somehow

10:58.720 --> 11:01.680
managed to miss the video that we uploaded yesterday, which I think is

11:02.800 --> 11:09.040
Probably not a thing because it has four million views or something like that already. Uh, yes, it's true

11:09.200 --> 11:14.480
I will be stepping down as ceo of linus media group and all its affiliated companies

11:15.200 --> 11:20.320
This isn't really a decision that happened overnight. I think for some people they probably feel like it did

11:20.320 --> 11:22.320
I saw a lot of people asking like

11:22.720 --> 11:24.720
It was it the

11:25.040 --> 11:29.920
The backpack controversy that precipitated. I'm sitting here going no no

11:30.560 --> 11:34.080
No, I actually did not lose any sleep over the backpack controversy

11:34.560 --> 11:37.760
Um, or actually really any of the major controversies this week

11:37.760 --> 11:40.720
I've definitely been like annoyed and frustrated

11:40.800 --> 11:46.800
But no, I haven't lost any sleep over them because the thing is I think a lot of people probably don't realize this

11:46.880 --> 11:49.280
but I am inside my own head

11:50.000 --> 11:57.520
And so I know if a major community concern is actually going to be a problem in the long term and if it's not then I just

11:59.600 --> 12:03.440
Get to do what I'm gonna do and you guys will see and everything will be fine

12:04.000 --> 12:07.120
So so I didn't I didn't lose a ton of sleep even if some people did

12:07.840 --> 12:12.400
But I would say that it's more just a cumulative effect

12:12.880 --> 12:14.800
I mean, I think luke could probably

12:15.440 --> 12:21.920
Could probably speak to this more than me, but I am not a detail oriented person

12:23.120 --> 12:28.720
And you know what's funny is that I can be very thorough in certain ways

12:29.040 --> 12:33.600
Like I can come in even for something that I don't work with day to day and I can go

12:34.080 --> 12:40.320
Hey, have you considered a b and x and y ways that we could potentially improve the workflow here or

12:40.960 --> 12:45.040
I you know from time to time again, like I'm not saying I'm some kind of genius

12:45.120 --> 12:48.240
I think I'm above average, but definitely not genius

12:48.560 --> 12:53.600
But I can come in and suggest something even in fields where I have like no experience

12:54.160 --> 13:00.880
Whether it's and I think the the solution we found for one of our upcoming screwdriver products was actually suggested by me

13:01.280 --> 13:05.680
And it was actually it was one of my favorite moments ever because I was like hey kyle

13:06.240 --> 13:08.240
Did we think of this and he's like

13:10.800 --> 13:12.400
No, actually

13:12.400 --> 13:14.400
And I'm like would that work he's like

13:14.960 --> 13:16.160
Ah

13:16.160 --> 13:18.160
Yeah, I think so

13:18.240 --> 13:19.280
Yes

13:19.280 --> 13:20.400
Got him

13:20.400 --> 13:23.840
Um, I can't I can't remember I can't remember a specific one

13:23.840 --> 13:27.840
But I remember suggesting something like development related to you at some point

13:28.240 --> 13:34.800
And I was like probably if this is dumb feel free to tell me because I know I I couldn't write a line of code to save my life

13:35.200 --> 13:36.800
um, and you're like

13:36.800 --> 13:41.600
No, a lot of code is just math and logic and that's actually a really logical way to solve the problem

13:41.680 --> 13:44.480
And like that might actually work. I don't remember if we ended up implementing it

13:44.480 --> 13:47.920
But it was like it was like not not stupid, but here's my problem

13:48.560 --> 13:52.080
My follow-up on any of that is basically zero

13:52.640 --> 14:01.920
um, my ability to to document a new process that I come up with whether it's myself or working collaboratively with someone is

14:02.880 --> 14:08.240
Basically zero. I mean, I remember James giving me a really hard time because he's sitting here going

14:09.280 --> 14:15.840
I'm trying to manage this writing department. I'm trying to create documents and processes and like training procedures

14:16.400 --> 14:17.440
and

14:17.440 --> 14:19.440
what I'm finding is that

14:20.240 --> 14:22.240
basically other than you just

14:23.200 --> 14:29.360
Talking to people and brain dumping on them anytime you see a problem. We don't have any

14:30.240 --> 14:32.240
And I'm like, yeah

14:32.240 --> 14:34.320
um pretty much

14:34.320 --> 14:37.280
I mean it worked for you, right? He's like, oh my that's not the point

14:39.360 --> 14:46.160
Because we have so many more people now, right and it's my my biggest pain point is is related to that

14:46.160 --> 14:52.240
But essentially it's the the transitioning from small to medium business like disseminating information now is kind of hard

14:53.200 --> 14:56.800
Um, I even ran into an issue where like I need to look into if I can mute

14:57.280 --> 14:59.280
reaction notifications on teams

14:59.920 --> 15:04.800
Because I like posted that float plane updated and people should use it in a different way and then my teams was just

15:05.040 --> 15:08.640
Constantly going off for the rest of the day. I was like, well, this is actually really annoying

15:10.160 --> 15:13.280
Like it's it's actually distracting at this point. Like I don't know

15:13.360 --> 15:17.840
I had something today where I we had an issue with a shoot this morning where

15:18.560 --> 15:24.400
Actually, no, I should back up. We had an issue with a shoot late yesterday where I arrived on set

15:24.800 --> 15:31.440
And it was set up for a static a cam with an operated b cam on sticks or on a tripod

15:31.840 --> 15:33.840
And I was looking at it going

15:34.480 --> 15:39.520
Hey, so I know that we recently reminded the writers and the

15:40.080 --> 15:44.560
Production team that they're supposed to have a b-roll meeting before the b-roll is shot for a video

15:45.280 --> 15:50.080
But it occurs to me that I don't think we ever formally said you can stop having an a-roll meeting

15:50.800 --> 15:52.800
and clearly that

15:52.880 --> 15:54.880
Well, did that happen here?

15:54.880 --> 15:55.680
and

15:55.680 --> 15:57.680
The answer was no and I'm like

15:57.680 --> 16:01.520
So have you guys so you guys haven't looked at the script together yet?

16:01.840 --> 16:04.640
And it was mostly pretty pretty new faces

16:05.120 --> 16:08.720
Relatively speaking so it's not like I'm mad at anyone or anything like that

16:09.200 --> 16:13.040
But it was pretty obvious based on the kind of video that it was

16:13.520 --> 16:16.640
That a static camera wasn't going to work at all

16:16.960 --> 16:22.640
There were little things that I need to hold up and show to the camera and then and then practical demonstrations

16:22.640 --> 16:27.680
That I needed to do that involved walking from one side of a table to another and plugging things ready for that stuff

16:27.920 --> 16:33.440
Yeah, and and and the camera operator again relatively new not going to name any names. It doesn't matter

16:33.520 --> 16:37.200
That's not the point the camera operators like yeah, well, I'm just going to follow you and I'm like

16:37.600 --> 16:40.880
Okay, but you got a you got to think end to end here, right?

16:41.200 --> 16:45.200
What if I move in a way that's unexpected now we have a delay while you track me

16:45.520 --> 16:47.520
We have a second delay while you focus

16:48.000 --> 16:53.360
Heaven forbid you need to alter your zoom or something like that or we're going to be stacking delay upon delay upon delay

16:53.760 --> 16:56.960
I'm going to have moved on by the time you've actually got me centered in the frame

16:57.280 --> 16:58.480
And he's like, oh, yeah

16:58.480 --> 17:03.440
I'm like, so that's a challenge that we've got to deal with here and what I feel like

17:03.600 --> 17:07.040
That's kind of how I phrased it is that uh, you guys haven't really

17:07.600 --> 17:14.640
synced up on how this is supposed to be shot because this is more than words on a page, right? This is this is

17:15.200 --> 17:16.880
a

17:16.880 --> 17:20.240
Bible for creating this video like this script

17:21.120 --> 17:23.920
So what I want you guys to do is spend the rest of the day

17:24.640 --> 17:26.240
Because this was pretty close to the end of the day

17:26.240 --> 17:27.920
We would have barely been able to get it shot

17:27.920 --> 17:30.560
So it's not like they were going to do this and then we were going to finish shooting it

17:30.560 --> 17:35.360
So I was like, okay spend the rest of the day. I'll go do something else make myself busy. That's not hard

17:37.200 --> 17:39.920
Go through it and then we'll pick this up again tomorrow morning

17:40.480 --> 17:41.600
I

17:41.600 --> 17:44.480
arrived tomorrow morning now the plan is

17:45.760 --> 17:53.360
I believe still to shoot on sticks. No, no the plan is I don't remember what the plan is but yeah, no the plan

17:54.640 --> 17:56.640
I don't remember the plan the plan was bad

17:57.200 --> 17:58.800
in in a nutshell

17:58.800 --> 18:04.320
Because the we had created some props to do the demos that I was going to do from one side of the other

18:04.640 --> 18:09.120
But the props were not applicable and then I was supposed to do something where I'm like

18:09.200 --> 18:13.840
I'm holding something up and the cables that or the cable that connected it

18:14.240 --> 18:15.200
It was so long

18:15.200 --> 18:19.520
It was like a four foot long cable that in order for me to show how it was connected

18:19.520 --> 18:22.800
I would have had to have my arms like this and the framing would have been so wide

18:22.800 --> 18:25.680
You wouldn't have been able to see the things in my hands and I was like

18:26.640 --> 18:33.040
You know what I think just happened here is you guys have never done this before and I basically just assumed

18:33.520 --> 18:35.520
That you would just know

18:36.720 --> 18:38.080
Tell you what

18:38.080 --> 18:39.760
Let's rewind

18:39.760 --> 18:44.320
I'm going to do this with you. I will do the read through the script and show you guys

18:44.960 --> 18:51.520
What's in my head and why so it needs to start on a close-up and the reason it needs to start on a close-up

18:51.520 --> 18:56.160
Is because the title and thumbnail is this and we need to see this product right away

18:56.720 --> 19:00.720
It needs to go wide and that has to be done with a zoom

19:00.960 --> 19:05.920
Not with a post production punch in because the previous shot needs to be quite detailed

19:06.400 --> 19:09.200
Then I'm going to talk for a little bit here

19:09.840 --> 19:13.840
And this is too long. This is too long for me to be standing and presenting

19:14.080 --> 19:19.680
So when we get to this point, we need to do some kind of transition so that I'm in kind of

19:20.560 --> 19:26.320
Talking to you and and showing you something rather than presenting to you and that's really important

19:26.320 --> 19:30.160
You've got to remember the way that people talk to each other the camera is the eyes

19:30.560 --> 19:35.760
Of another participant and what is essentially just a one-sided conversation if you think of it that way

19:36.160 --> 19:40.960
Like that's that's what that's the point. That's the whole point of youtube is that

19:41.840 --> 19:46.640
They're not necessarily talking to the other characters on camera. They can be but

19:47.360 --> 19:49.760
It's for it's for you. It's personal, right?

19:50.160 --> 19:53.280
And so if we're not engaging in that way if you're not

19:53.840 --> 19:57.920
Coming in close and tilting the camera down a little bit as I show you something

19:59.120 --> 20:03.360
It's going to feel unnatural to the viewer even though they have no idea why

20:04.320 --> 20:07.280
and so I I I did this little workshop and

20:07.680 --> 20:13.520
The point which I'm finally coming around to one story is that I did this workshop for like four people

20:14.160 --> 20:20.800
Um, and I realized after I was done that there's at least another four probably more like another 14

20:21.040 --> 20:23.540
That need to know that and now it's lost forever

20:24.960 --> 20:26.960
Whoops

20:27.200 --> 20:28.720
So how do we fix that?

20:28.720 --> 20:32.880
Do do I just like start selfie camera recording myself giving this workshop?

20:32.960 --> 20:37.200
Do we send it to everybody after sometimes? I mean, you know me and sometimes I don't even know

20:37.280 --> 20:39.440
I'm about to for float plane. We have a knowledge

20:39.440 --> 20:43.520
We have a thing called a knowledge base, but how do I get what just happened in it?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.840
Yeah, so in this case you would have to record it

20:46.160 --> 20:50.320
Yeah, and then you would put it in a knowledge base title it properly and then people could look it up whenever they want

20:50.400 --> 20:56.160
I don't always know when I'm about to do a knowledge base article. That's my problem. Well, it's one of my problems

20:57.440 --> 20:59.440
You'd have to redo it at that point pretty much

20:59.760 --> 21:04.880
Unfortunately because once you did it once and you had that recognition that like this is information people should be able to look out

21:04.960 --> 21:06.640
And you'd have to do it again

21:06.640 --> 21:07.760
Yeah

21:07.840 --> 21:10.000
Um, but then he doesn't have time

21:13.520 --> 21:17.520
Yeah, only there was four people that you just gave a workshop to who could

21:18.240 --> 21:23.760
Feel their knowledge and yeah, the thing is I especially don't have time to redo the workshop

21:24.160 --> 21:28.880
So I should do it once but the problem too is that the med is always changing

21:29.360 --> 21:35.360
Like if I if I record something like that today, I mean some of it is some of it is usable forever

21:35.600 --> 21:39.200
You have to plan for what the visual is going to be you have to actually

21:39.680 --> 21:43.200
Not just look at the script and make sure you've got everything on the props list

21:43.520 --> 21:45.280
You've got to think about

21:45.280 --> 21:47.920
What is he supposed to hold up when he's reading this paragraph?

21:48.400 --> 21:53.360
If somebody isn't standing right side out right out of frame ready to toss it or ready to hand it

21:53.840 --> 21:55.840
Then we have to stop the shoot

21:56.080 --> 21:57.200
Get it

21:57.200 --> 22:02.800
Get someone in position and restart the shoot that is incredibly disruptive to our workflow

22:02.880 --> 22:06.240
And we waste a ton of time with me arriving on set going

22:06.560 --> 22:09.520
Hey, this is great. You brought this hdmi cable

22:09.680 --> 22:14.800
But did you bring the adapter that we need to plug it into this ancient gpu that doesn't have hdmi?

22:16.080 --> 22:20.880
No, okay. Well, I guess we'll go get that. Oh, no now we keep all our inventory over at the lab

22:20.880 --> 22:24.400
But it's going to cost us like 20 minutes to go get this thing like we waste

22:25.040 --> 22:30.160
So much time and so what I'm hoping is that if I can focus more on

22:30.880 --> 22:32.880
This type of thing on helping people

22:33.680 --> 22:35.680
think visually I guess

22:37.440 --> 22:43.600
And and you know more thoroughly then maybe yeah, maybe maybe I will be able to be in more videos

22:43.600 --> 22:48.960
I've been in like two short circuits in the last two and a half months or something like that. I love short circuit

22:49.360 --> 22:51.360
Short circuit is so easy

22:54.160 --> 22:59.600
It's like youtuber easy mode the story is the product in front of you. It's like how line of sect have started

22:59.680 --> 23:04.720
Yeah, it's like I could because it was easy. I could do short circuit in my sleep

23:04.960 --> 23:07.920
And I actually like I kind of enjoy it because I can just

23:08.400 --> 23:13.120
Sit and kind of experience the product. I don't have to think about hosting it like when I was doing um

23:14.000 --> 23:18.080
Uh, the the d brand nintendo switch tears of the kingdom edition or whatever

23:18.880 --> 23:24.480
I'm just having fun. I don't care. There was an air obviously they were way worse than what short circuit is currently

23:24.480 --> 23:26.960
But there was an era where we'd do like eight of those an hour

23:30.160 --> 23:31.680
Oh

23:31.680 --> 23:36.480
Man, they are gonna be good though. That's the other thing is I want

23:37.120 --> 23:45.040
My role as chief vision officer to be really focused in the early days on getting the lab and the writing team

23:45.920 --> 23:48.160
synergized because right now

23:48.880 --> 23:52.960
The writing team is really great at creativity. I mean like okay

23:53.440 --> 23:58.960
I'm not singling anyone out, but I'm gonna give a gold star to to adam from the writing team like

23:59.600 --> 24:03.520
That guy writes intros sometimes that I just look at and I go like

24:04.560 --> 24:05.520
Where did this come from?

24:05.520 --> 24:10.720
Yeah, yeah, okay, like uh, he's the one who wrote the the cheerleader thing for um

24:11.360 --> 24:18.080
For a chromebooks or whatever where we had like this he wrote this cheer for it and everybody has pom poms and everything

24:18.160 --> 24:20.160
I'm I'm looking at this going like

24:21.760 --> 24:24.480
I mean I love it, but really

24:24.880 --> 24:26.880
Yeah

24:27.440 --> 24:33.200
And and to his credit he's actually pretty darn good when it comes to understanding the analytical side of things too

24:33.200 --> 24:35.280
He's actually done some really good work that you guys

24:37.120 --> 24:38.720
We'll see eventually

24:38.720 --> 24:43.680
Um at some point with a new product release of some sort that will have a lot of graphs

24:44.400 --> 24:49.680
Anyway, he's done some really good work on on on graphing for us and and automating taking in that labs data

24:50.080 --> 24:55.120
But the writing team by and large is really really great creatively

24:55.600 --> 24:58.480
And really really passionate about about technology

24:58.960 --> 25:00.960
But not necessarily as

25:01.840 --> 25:07.600
Scientifically rigorous as the labs team, which is made up of engineers, right? Yeah

25:08.640 --> 25:12.480
Meanwhile the labs team is really good at like

25:13.120 --> 25:19.360
Nailing down process. They're trying to figure out like iso whatever the crap and I'm just kind of sitting here going

25:19.840 --> 25:21.840
I just want to know if it's loud, you know

25:21.840 --> 25:29.360
But but obviously I let them I let them do their thing because that's why we hire good people who want iso whatever stuff

25:29.920 --> 25:35.360
Um, the point is, you know, those guys are really great at being super analytical

25:35.760 --> 25:39.040
But they don't always necessarily see the content

25:39.600 --> 25:46.400
In what they're doing like the labs has uh has given pushback on a concept where I wanted to just

25:46.960 --> 25:50.640
Like grab the cheapest power supplies that we had kicking around here

25:50.880 --> 25:56.480
And see how many of them we could blow up with the power supply tester before we got the proper oscilloscope and all the training on it

25:56.720 --> 25:58.720
And they're like

26:00.080 --> 26:04.640
But that's not very you know, I'm like, I don't care. It's it's a sick power supply tester

26:04.720 --> 26:08.000
It's got a load load generator module and it let's blow up some

26:08.960 --> 26:14.720
Go boom. Yeah, it's gonna be awesome. Um, they're oh, I really think we should wait until whatever blue flames the most

26:14.720 --> 26:16.720
I mean, you could you could wait forever

26:17.040 --> 26:19.920
You could wait forever to do things the most as properly

26:20.240 --> 26:27.520
I want to make content about the process like did you have any idea how do you have any idea how advanced mark benches right now?

26:28.400 --> 26:30.400
Some what yeah mark bench is

26:30.640 --> 26:36.560
Incredible. Yeah, and nobody told me anything the last time anybody gave me an update on mark bench

26:37.040 --> 26:42.960
It was just uh pretty much an auto hotkey script that would automatically not quite

26:43.600 --> 26:48.080
It wasn't much more sophisticated than that though. This was back when they were still working upstairs here

26:48.160 --> 26:51.200
Okay, yeah, the last time anybody updated me on mark bench

26:51.280 --> 26:57.200
It was pretty much an auto hotkey script that would just kind of cycle through the buttons in the menu to run a canned benchmark

26:58.240 --> 27:00.240
It was pretty unsophisticated

27:00.320 --> 27:04.880
It was something that i'm sure reviewers around the world have been doing basically since the dawn of time

27:04.960 --> 27:06.960
Yeah, we got roasted for it. I was like guys

27:07.280 --> 27:10.000
This is not the end goal like relax. Do you remember that?

27:10.240 --> 27:14.080
Do you know so annoying do you know what it can do now?

27:15.120 --> 27:19.520
Okay, it uses so there's a there's a head unit you guys are going to see this in more detail

27:19.520 --> 27:22.320
You're going to see this in action in the upcoming labs tour

27:22.560 --> 27:28.800
But there's a head unit that sits under the desk that right now is monitoring the output with like api

27:29.120 --> 27:32.240
So what would the what's actually running the api?

27:33.200 --> 27:36.320
So that would be on the oh, you don't even know this saying right now

27:36.800 --> 27:39.760
Are you talking to ocr when it's reading the screen? Is that it?

27:40.400 --> 27:41.360
Yeah

27:41.360 --> 27:45.120
Yeah, yeah something's running an api and it something hooks in one of them hooks into the other

27:45.680 --> 27:48.400
So it must be the clients that are hooking into the server machine

27:51.680 --> 27:54.800
I'm not entirely sure which part of the chain you're talking about right now, but it doesn't matter

27:55.040 --> 28:02.720
The point is there's there's a head unit that is monitoring the screen outputs of all three of the stations and can apparently scale beyond that

28:03.120 --> 28:05.920
And it is basically looking for text

28:06.400 --> 28:12.160
So ocr is optical character recognition and what that does is it tells it

28:12.720 --> 28:20.400
Hey, there's an unexpected state here and it can log that and spit out errors and get this it gets even better

28:20.720 --> 28:22.720
It can actually use that

28:23.280 --> 28:28.320
That optical recognition of what's going on on the screens to chop down all the footage

28:28.400 --> 28:32.480
We record of the benchmarks and gameplay so that either we could

28:33.040 --> 28:40.080
Splace them together if we wanted to show actual gaming footage off of these cards for the final video or we could

28:41.280 --> 28:44.640
Or we could automatically edit them together if the

28:45.360 --> 28:52.400
Labs tech or if the writer wanted to just you know, see if anything anomalous happened in terms of image quality

28:53.920 --> 28:57.200
It's a very good idea to have it's something that we've talked about since the beginning

28:57.200 --> 29:00.720
It can it does error handling so if a benchmark crashes

29:00.960 --> 29:05.520
It'll say hey, uh, we're on the main menu right now. That's probably not where we're supposed to be

29:05.920 --> 29:10.400
It can navigate menus. So what we saw running is that now

29:11.120 --> 29:15.200
It can so it can navigate menus and then it's a separate thing that is

29:15.760 --> 29:19.680
That is also running on the head unit. I believe that can handle input as well

29:20.080 --> 29:26.000
So in our upcoming reviews of products that we'll have at some point that will have lots of graphs

29:26.960 --> 29:28.960
NDA

29:29.520 --> 29:35.440
We are going to have gaming benchmarks for games that do not have built-in benchmarks

29:36.160 --> 29:39.920
Which is so cool because we can just navigate the menu

29:40.560 --> 29:42.160
Open up a save

29:42.160 --> 29:45.760
Move our character. We've got it down to about I think 1% is the target

29:45.760 --> 29:51.680
I think we've got two games that are able to achieve within what 1% run to run variants

29:52.080 --> 29:57.600
Which is so cool and we don't have to because we used to do this, but it was like an insane volume of manual work

29:59.200 --> 30:05.520
No longer. Yeah, not anymore and it wasn't as reproducible whereas now the whole thing is being input by machine

30:07.840 --> 30:09.360
It's pretty sick

30:09.360 --> 30:11.360
No one thought to tell me this

30:11.760 --> 30:15.760
We could have made an entire video about the progress on mark bench

30:16.240 --> 30:19.760
And now it's just bundled into some lab update, which is fine

30:20.000 --> 30:25.280
You know we should do a lab update and I guess now you guys get the information even more packed

30:25.760 --> 30:28.400
But they are doing so much cool stuff over there

30:29.280 --> 30:31.840
That we are not making videos about

30:32.800 --> 30:35.840
How often do you want like do you consider

30:36.560 --> 30:38.560
over saturation

30:39.600 --> 30:46.880
In what sense like if we had if we had two videos on various mark bench milestones between the last

30:47.760 --> 30:52.400
Two things between the last video we did on labs and this most recent update. Is that too much?

30:53.120 --> 30:57.200
Um, it's more that I think in the labs update. We wouldn't include mark bench then

30:57.200 --> 31:01.840
We would just talk about other stuff and but mark bench could have been its own video for sure

31:02.240 --> 31:09.440
And really what it comes down to like how often we should release a new video about mark bench comes down to title and thumbnail

31:10.560 --> 31:12.560
If we have a title

31:12.560 --> 31:14.560
uh, you know

31:15.200 --> 31:17.600
So that that would kind of require probably

31:18.240 --> 31:23.120
What you're saying like more integration of you into what they're doing. Yeah. Yeah, so that I could tell them. Hey

31:23.600 --> 31:27.680
This is super. This is titleable. Uh, yes, I can make this clicky. Yes

31:28.560 --> 31:31.520
That that's the key right because that's what makes something a youtube video

31:31.600 --> 31:38.560
I I don't I don't need anything other than a title and thumbnail and I can probably entertain for anywhere from nine to 15 minutes

31:38.560 --> 31:42.320
Without too much difficulty, uh, but what I really need is a title and thumbnail

31:42.560 --> 31:44.400
So, okay, let's say that

31:45.040 --> 31:51.520
mark bench got more powerful and all of a sudden oh for the machine vision it needs an upgrade

31:52.160 --> 31:57.360
And uh, by the way, we're going to parallelize all the benchmarking that we're doing to an even greater degree

31:57.680 --> 32:01.440
And there's a couple of more harnesses for new games. I'm going let's go

32:01.920 --> 32:07.040
okay, uh, all the all the stations need to be up on a rack

32:07.760 --> 32:13.680
And I've got a gaming headset on in the in the thumbnail and I've got like a controller or a keyboard mouse. I'm like

32:14.720 --> 32:19.680
I'm I'm benchmarking 12 computers. Yeah, and they're all and they're all there or whatever

32:20.240 --> 32:23.200
Boom easy easy people will click on that no problem

32:23.520 --> 32:28.000
And then we just explain all those things and show how it's all working and we go through this story of you know

32:28.320 --> 32:33.920
How machine vision works and you know why we needed a more powerful GPU in order to run more stations at once

32:34.160 --> 32:38.000
Why we didn't need a more powerful CPU or why we did need more ram. What did we need?

32:38.080 --> 32:38.880
What didn't we need?

32:38.880 --> 32:41.760
How does the storage for all this work? How does the storage for all this work?

32:41.760 --> 32:46.240
Is it actually storing like screen recording from all of them or like what what what what are we doing? I believe so

32:47.600 --> 32:53.760
To a certain degree. Okay, so we found this motherboard with 12 pcie slots so we could fill it with capture cards like I don't know

32:54.640 --> 32:59.040
But let's tell that story darn it some amount. I think it might be temporal. I don't remember

32:59.680 --> 33:01.280
I need to spend more time with that

33:01.280 --> 33:02.800
Exactly

33:02.800 --> 33:09.600
Exactly, they're over there doing the coolest stuff in this entire stupid building flow planes have been pants on fire for a long time

33:09.600 --> 33:14.240
So I've been neglecting. Yeah, I get it and I'm just I'm not I'm not talking about any of it

33:15.280 --> 33:21.360
So I'm excited. I'm excited. That's gonna be that's gonna be really awesome. Um, and I think that

33:22.080 --> 33:24.080
Given that the lab

33:24.080 --> 33:29.920
Is the biggest investment we've made into moat building pretty much since we started the company

33:30.320 --> 33:32.320
If we are not

33:32.320 --> 33:35.360
Utilizing it properly that's going to be terrible

33:35.920 --> 33:41.760
Uh, oh the reason I started talking about the lab though was what I'm really excited about is what's going to be happening for short circuit

33:42.560 --> 33:48.960
Man, we are going to be able to do like eight minute power supply videos that are literally everything

33:48.960 --> 33:55.360
You could possibly need to know about it. Don't even bother looking at the manufacturing website that psu tester is so cool

33:55.680 --> 33:59.440
and the the person who's been brought in to operate it

34:00.320 --> 34:05.040
Has been really great so far apparently and we're really really really excited

34:05.040 --> 34:08.800
It's going to be set up and ready to go hopefully in the next like few weeks

34:09.200 --> 34:15.680
And the first video we have planned is going to be like a sub 40 power supply round up because isn't that what we need to know?

34:17.200 --> 34:23.200
Like yeah with basic equipment like what a lot of other sites are using you can tell if it's going to

34:23.600 --> 34:25.600
Immediately set your computer on fire

34:26.080 --> 34:28.320
But which one is actually good?

34:30.720 --> 34:34.880
Don't know I don't know don't know there's a bunch of that type of content that hasn't been

34:35.680 --> 34:39.280
What were we talking about recently cell phones and they're like

34:39.760 --> 34:41.040
Uh signal

34:41.040 --> 34:46.480
Yeah, yeah who has better reception. I don't know that used to be something that was in a lot of cell phone reviews

34:46.480 --> 34:49.680
Oh for sure people would talk about all the time and then it hasn't been a thing for quite a while though

34:49.920 --> 34:53.680
Yep. Well, it was really hard to do. It was really hard to do

34:54.640 --> 35:01.520
Repeatedly with a really sophisticated equipment. Yeah, and I think that's one of the reasons why it actually faded away

35:01.520 --> 35:04.640
It was a lot of the testing that was being done was kind of junk. Yeah

35:05.680 --> 35:11.920
So so either stops doing it either they were a site that or an outlet that didn't care and didn't bother

35:12.400 --> 35:17.360
Or they were a site or outlet that did care and realized that what they were doing was worthless. Yeah

35:18.400 --> 35:20.400
So so goodbye

35:20.560 --> 35:22.000
Yeah

35:22.000 --> 35:28.320
Yeah, I'm really I'm really excited about power supplies. We're really excited about what we're going to be able to do with rf men

35:28.880 --> 35:33.840
Um, I found out how much that rf chamber cost. You didn't know I didn't I did

35:34.640 --> 35:36.640
I didn't

35:38.480 --> 35:43.840
Yeah, so cool room. Yeah, it's a pretty cool room. Yeah, I thought it was six figures

35:43.840 --> 35:46.240
I didn't think it was deep six figures. Yeah

35:47.040 --> 35:49.040
Yeah, yep. Yeah, but but

35:49.760 --> 35:51.920
I got a I got a shout out Raymond DMC

35:52.400 --> 35:59.680
Uh, apparently we're we're doing some some cross promotional like we're doing some marketing for them and it's yeah, it's

36:01.040 --> 36:05.040
Not costing a lot or something. I don't know the exact deal

36:05.760 --> 36:08.400
But we have a video coming on our rf chamber soon

36:09.360 --> 36:14.160
And it's freaking sick. It's very cool. Yeah, it's genuinely very cool

36:14.880 --> 36:20.480
Like really amazing really excited about that. Uh, so there's the rf chamber. There's power supplies

36:21.040 --> 36:25.200
Uh, man gpu testing is going to be amazing with some of the changes to mark bench

36:26.080 --> 36:28.080
We we were already

36:29.120 --> 36:33.520
We were already running new fresh benchmarks, um for every review

36:34.160 --> 36:40.720
And you guys are going to continue to see that which I I'm not sure who else is actually doing that right now

36:40.720 --> 36:46.000
Because it's extremely time consuming and with the kind of crunch that you're operating on for these gpu reviews

36:46.080 --> 36:51.840
It's really really tough to do but we are going to be doing even more testing. Um

36:54.000 --> 36:57.120
Yeah, I'm just trying to think like what else is what else is kind of shaken so

36:58.320 --> 37:01.200
That's it. I am the chief vision officer

37:01.840 --> 37:08.720
Oh, yeah, the moat building right so when I say moat building the the goal is not to to like aggressively

37:08.960 --> 37:15.120
You know attack other media outlets. That's why I referred to it as a moat and not as like a catapult defensive maneuver

37:15.680 --> 37:22.640
Yeah, like the idea is just by by elevating our content by making things the best that we possibly can

37:23.120 --> 37:25.440
Uh, we're putting ourselves in a position where

37:26.320 --> 37:30.560
Other people are just going to have to make bigger investments if they want to match us for content

37:30.960 --> 37:37.840
I had some people kind of criticize me for that like moat building and I guess there is kind of a negative connotation there but

37:38.640 --> 37:43.840
Shouldn't everyone be trying to do the absolute best they can to make the best content they possibly can

37:43.920 --> 37:49.840
I don't think that's the only approach either to be honest because we're doing like all of the things under the sun

37:51.040 --> 37:53.040
And you could specialize

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah, that's not really is that uh

37:56.480 --> 37:58.480
Yeah, it's not really like

37:58.480 --> 37:59.520
Okay, sure

37:59.520 --> 38:05.520
So what you're saying is like you would build your moat but like a small moat around a small castle by by like conquering a niche

38:05.760 --> 38:09.120
You were mentioning like oh other people are gonna have to up their investment. It's like well not

38:10.080 --> 38:14.720
In the same way though. Oh, sure. I see what you mean. Yeah, it could be in a smaller way around a smaller niche

38:15.200 --> 38:19.840
Absolutely. I mean I've talked about how I think in a big way. That's a few that's the future of the platform

38:19.840 --> 38:23.840
Yeah, is smaller smaller niche specialist channels. So

38:24.560 --> 38:29.920
um, the way that my vision kind of looks right now is we're going to have to find a way

38:30.480 --> 38:37.760
To match that and I think the way to do that is by centralizing a lot of great testing with great testing equipment

38:38.160 --> 38:38.880
and

38:38.880 --> 38:40.880
Really knowledgeable people

38:40.880 --> 38:47.280
Generating data and then taking that and disseminating it across a wide variety of channels

38:47.360 --> 38:52.480
Be they written or video or podcast or whatever it is that they are

38:53.280 --> 38:56.800
That's the way that we're going to be able to leverage our strength

38:56.880 --> 39:03.680
Which is our size while also competing with you know scrappy, you know smaller operations

39:04.800 --> 39:07.120
That's the vision chief vision officer. Let's go

39:07.760 --> 39:12.640
Want to pick our next topic? Are you are you tired of talking about it yet? Um

39:14.080 --> 39:20.480
Which part of it just any part of it? I feel like you've probably just had constant conversations since it was done

39:20.880 --> 39:27.120
Um sort of actually, you know what internally only a couple of people messaged me after monday morning meeting

39:27.680 --> 39:32.160
Uh, even externally. I only had maybe like half a dozen people message me about it

39:32.480 --> 39:35.920
The thing is that I'm kind of antisocial so I don't really talk to people

39:40.080 --> 39:44.480
I mean I messaged taren about it. Obviously he was like, hey, thanks for the heads up and I was like, yeah

39:45.440 --> 39:50.320
I had no idea it was coming. We pushed this like massive float plane update and then it was like well

39:51.360 --> 39:53.360
happy it works

39:54.400 --> 39:58.400
Yeah, what did he what did he say? I forget I forget what he actually said about it

39:58.960 --> 40:02.960
Um, yeah, thanks for the heads up. I go ha ha no problem. He goes ha ha

40:06.080 --> 40:09.280
I have random people. I don't know messaging me already

40:09.600 --> 40:14.240
Dude reddit was covered in his face because people just making memes about it and stuff

40:15.440 --> 40:19.680
It generally like good hearted. I think so yeah, it's good. Yeah, it's good overall

40:19.760 --> 40:24.000
I've been really happy with the support from the community. Thank you so much guys

40:24.160 --> 40:29.120
I really do agree with most of the community that says they think this is going to be a positive change

40:29.520 --> 40:31.120
I do too. I just

40:31.120 --> 40:34.960
Uh, man, what was some stupid administrative thing that I had to deal with this week?

40:34.960 --> 40:39.120
You know, it doesn't matter. I think it's going to be hard to say without saying anything identifiable

40:39.680 --> 40:40.720
Just

40:40.800 --> 40:45.680
It doesn't matter. I every time someone contacts me at this point about something that

40:46.640 --> 40:49.680
Is not going to be my problem in two weeks. I'm just like

40:50.240 --> 40:51.600
Yeah

40:51.600 --> 40:53.600
Two weeks dang it six weeks. Oh

40:54.640 --> 40:58.160
I'm checked out already. Just I just ask them every time. Can this wait six weeks?

41:00.160 --> 41:03.680
This is how to be dealt with now. I don't even have to do that. I can just ask them to wait two weeks

41:04.320 --> 41:06.320
And then do that again and then one more time

41:07.040 --> 41:12.000
That's the vision officer, dude. Yeah, that's how I deal with family members that I don't want to see very often

41:12.080 --> 41:17.440
Just delay repeatedly. Yeah. Yeah. So what you do what what the is what's happening with the workout day then you know

41:18.800 --> 41:26.080
No, actually, that's a whole that's a whole thing. So uh, so so the trick the trick is that you um

41:27.600 --> 41:29.600
You schedule something

41:29.600 --> 41:31.600
really far out

41:31.600 --> 41:35.200
And then but not so far out that they'll try to schedule something in between

41:35.600 --> 41:39.680
But far out enough that okay. So first you wait as long as possible

41:40.240 --> 41:46.560
Right, then when it's finally time to do something you schedule it first far out as you can where there won't really be room to do

41:46.560 --> 41:51.440
Something in between and then you won't have to hear about it until then then you rinse and repeat

41:51.520 --> 41:55.200
And that's how you can kind of get down from like monthly to

41:56.000 --> 42:00.800
Realistically special occasions and like a couple of other times a year. That's that's a trick

42:01.920 --> 42:03.920
That's the that's the strap. That's the strap

42:05.040 --> 42:06.240
Yeah

42:06.240 --> 42:10.800
Okay, what do you want to talk about now? Uh, we can talk about the tv. Let's talk about the tv

42:11.360 --> 42:13.360
startup offers a free tv

42:15.760 --> 42:16.960
It spies on you

42:16.960 --> 42:22.800
Uh, it's a startup called tele and it will soon be offering a free 55 inch 4k hdr television

42:23.040 --> 42:28.880
That comes with a second banner screen, which is just like a very ultra wide screen

42:29.600 --> 42:33.040
That goes underneath that constantly plays ads

42:34.000 --> 42:37.840
The ads are designed to not interrupt the television viewing experience

42:38.080 --> 42:45.440
But just in case you are concerned about it the 55 inch screen above can also just play ads when it's not in use

42:45.680 --> 42:47.680
Just to make sure that you're fully saturated

42:48.400 --> 42:54.480
The built-in sound bar includes a microphone and motion tracking camera with privacy shutter

42:54.720 --> 42:56.720
According to tele's published

42:56.720 --> 43:01.680
Policies the tv may collect information about the audio and video content you watch

43:02.000 --> 43:07.600
Search queries the physical presence of anyone in the room and it may collect names email addresses

43:07.920 --> 43:11.200
phone numbers ages dates of birth same

43:12.080 --> 43:19.920
Sort of thing uh zip codes precise geolocation gender ethnicity and sexual life or sexual orientation

43:20.240 --> 43:25.120
And also political beliefs like environmentalism, which you don't have if you own this tv

43:25.520 --> 43:31.520
If users opt out of data collection, they will have to return the television or have their credit card charged

43:32.560 --> 43:36.720
$500 nice the company claims they will ship half a million

43:37.440 --> 43:40.240
Half a million units, uh starting this summer

43:42.160 --> 43:44.720
Wow, I think we should get one

43:45.360 --> 43:50.400
Oh, yeah as soon as I saw this I was like I am all over this because we have to try to figure out how to

43:51.040 --> 43:52.240
Spoof it

43:52.240 --> 43:56.000
That's my opinion that would be sick. We should try to fit like the motion presence thing

43:56.080 --> 43:59.120
I'll just like set up some stuff like make it think that's things are going on

44:00.320 --> 44:04.000
So we just need like one of those little humping dog usb things

44:04.560 --> 44:08.880
So that it thinks it's monitoring your sex life or whatever it just goes continuously

44:10.720 --> 44:12.720
Oh man, I don't know

44:13.280 --> 44:18.960
Holy crap like if you could I mean if you could somehow have it so like the main screen

44:20.240 --> 44:25.360
Was viewable by you but that second screen was like turned around or something

44:25.520 --> 44:31.520
But there was stuff there to trick it into thinking that it was tracking things. Okay, mr. Lafrenier. Oh my

44:32.880 --> 44:38.640
You know, it's serious when he pulls out the last name. I'm I'm sorry. I've got to say I actually don't think this is a big deal

44:39.600 --> 44:44.720
Really because it's like all already happening. Well, oh really you just

44:45.760 --> 44:47.760
You can't let me build there

44:49.040 --> 44:50.240
Think about it

44:50.240 --> 44:56.960
We've seen recently all the stuff that's been coming out about tesla employees having access to footage collected from the cars

44:57.200 --> 45:03.520
Including like, you know people performing sex acts. Um, you know, we've seen the way that I mean

45:04.160 --> 45:06.400
honestly, I would say that

45:07.360 --> 45:14.640
My digital communication through email is probably more intimate than a camera in my living room

45:15.440 --> 45:17.440
honestly

45:18.160 --> 45:21.040
Would you disagree no I could see that and

45:21.760 --> 45:27.600
I'm not even the kind of person who just posts everything about my personal life to facebook

45:28.480 --> 45:34.320
For someone who already posts every thought that enters their mind on facebook or twitter

45:34.720 --> 45:39.120
It's not true for everyone though. No, but for those people. Yeah, realistically

45:39.680 --> 45:44.080
What f***ing difference does a tv in their living room with a camera on it make?

45:45.520 --> 45:47.840
Honestly, I think I think the main thing

45:48.320 --> 45:51.600
Uh, I think the main difference personally would be that this one the point

45:52.320 --> 45:54.320
And what you are agreeing to

45:54.800 --> 45:56.000
is the

45:56.000 --> 45:58.720
Capture of that data whereas like the tesla thing

45:59.120 --> 46:00.320
I

46:00.320 --> 46:04.480
People are gonna get four dollars in a class action lawsuit because of it. That's huge

46:05.920 --> 46:09.520
I mean, yeah, I guess I just I just mean this isn't new

46:10.080 --> 46:11.280
Look at how okay

46:11.280 --> 46:17.600
Look at the difference in cost between the uh, the ad supported version of the facebook or the meta

46:17.840 --> 46:22.080
I don't know whatever the quest the difference between the personal version and the business version

46:22.080 --> 46:24.160
It was well like 200 300 dollars or something like that

46:24.160 --> 46:29.520
I remember but it's a lot but but that was the first time that I had ever had an apples to apples comparison

46:30.080 --> 46:32.080
of the same service

46:32.240 --> 46:38.160
In the personal information supported version and the hey, we actually need to make some money on this version

46:38.240 --> 46:40.960
I shouldn't say the first when I signed up for g-suite

46:41.680 --> 46:43.680
In the early days it was pretty inexpensive

46:43.680 --> 46:50.160
But nowadays services like g-suite are not actually our google workspace or whatever they call it now are not actually that cheap

46:50.480 --> 46:56.080
I have easily spent 500 on my email account in the years that I've been operating it

46:56.480 --> 46:59.840
You the free gmail user have spent nothing. Why?

47:00.480 --> 47:06.480
Because google has gotten 500 of value from you. That's that's math. That's how that works, right?

47:06.880 --> 47:13.120
And so if these guys are saying yeah, this is like a basic tier 500 tv, which we know because

47:13.760 --> 47:19.280
We're really smart and you can just buy it for 55 inch does not make it a theater display

47:19.520 --> 47:26.640
It's 55 inches, which is pretty decent size, but they charge you 500 bucks if you don't agree to the policy anymore, right?

47:27.360 --> 47:29.200
500 bucks. Yeah

47:29.200 --> 47:34.320
Yeah, I'll record a constant recording of your living room is probably worth that

47:34.720 --> 47:39.040
And you've probably already traded your soul for that amount of money before

47:40.240 --> 47:47.520
So i'm not saying you should do it. I'm just saying you're doing it already. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's fair enough

47:47.680 --> 47:54.400
I do think there's there's easier steps one can take to reduce this amount of stuff. Sure if they don't

47:54.800 --> 47:56.800
Yeah, do something like this

47:56.880 --> 48:02.480
Um, especially if you're not like a social media person, which if you're not doing it for your job

48:02.560 --> 48:05.760
I would kind of pretty highly suggest you probably do less than you are

48:06.560 --> 48:09.280
Because it just rots your brain. Um, but like

48:11.360 --> 48:13.360
Yeah, I don't know I

48:14.240 --> 48:19.680
When they said their stat, I don't remember where it was. Oh, yeah, the company claims they will ship half a million units starting this summer

48:22.480 --> 48:24.480
Yeah, probably maybe more

48:25.040 --> 48:28.160
I suspect people will jump on this for sure. Oh, yeah

48:28.560 --> 48:33.840
We've got we've got people in the chat like dude whose face is in public doesn't see how being in someone's image database

48:33.840 --> 48:38.480
Might not be someone else's cup of tea. Of course. I do that's not my point at all

48:38.960 --> 48:45.280
He's saying a very large percentage of users are doing that stuff anyways. So if you're security conscious

48:46.240 --> 48:49.840
Obviously, this is not for you very obviously, but you already knew that

48:50.880 --> 48:52.880
so like

48:53.200 --> 48:57.440
Yeah, I don't know there's a there's a ton of people that like put

48:58.400 --> 49:04.240
Way too much information out there. Yeah, absolutely like those those facebook quizzes that like ask you every

49:04.640 --> 49:09.840
Weird personal detail you could ever have as a secret question answer because they're farming secret question answers

49:10.160 --> 49:12.160
People fill those out all the time

49:12.720 --> 49:17.280
Yep, and this is this one feels really invasive and egregious

49:17.840 --> 49:20.560
But i'm willing to bet there was a okay

49:21.280 --> 49:23.600
And this okay, this actually may not be true

49:23.920 --> 49:28.400
But I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a similar reaction to the first billboard on the highway

49:29.040 --> 49:31.040
Like oh, it's distracting. It's an eyesore

49:31.760 --> 49:33.760
Or you know the first full page

49:33.920 --> 49:37.600
I still hate billboards or the first full page advertising spread in a newspaper

49:38.160 --> 49:41.760
What this isn't even this isn't even content. This is just ads

49:42.400 --> 49:44.400
I paid for this news. I paid for this

49:44.640 --> 49:48.400
Exactly exactly this this slow boil

49:49.040 --> 49:52.160
has been happening for over a century at this point

49:53.760 --> 49:55.760
And what's next?

49:56.240 --> 50:01.200
I guess that's where i'm going with this right like i'm it's not that i'm not outraged

50:01.520 --> 50:04.800
I i'm just i'm just saying like this feels like a logical step

50:04.800 --> 50:08.240
We've literally talked about how tv's are going to do this eventually on the wind show in the past

50:08.400 --> 50:14.000
Yeah, oh and that and I mean, I think there's already like I think there's already patented technology that someone

50:14.160 --> 50:20.480
That we talked about on wind show from someone that monitors monitors your eyes that uses eye tracking to tell if you're actually looking at ads

50:20.480 --> 50:22.480
or not right like that's

50:23.360 --> 50:26.240
This is a logical step from there

50:26.240 --> 50:29.200
I mean, I didn't think it was going to just have like a full

50:29.840 --> 50:31.840
Full motion camera

50:31.920 --> 50:37.600
necessarily I thought I thought eye tracking would be enough but at every stage we just kind of get used to

50:38.160 --> 50:43.200
Yeah, this seems this seems normal now. So so sorry. No, no, I actually want an answer to that

50:43.200 --> 50:48.640
I want to hear from you guys. Okay full plane chat. What's next? What's the next one?

50:49.360 --> 50:51.360
is it now uh

50:51.680 --> 50:53.680
in your in your

50:53.680 --> 50:58.080
Bedroom, I mean, well then again, you know, you already look at like echo dots right there everywhere

50:58.560 --> 51:03.760
The number of people that probably have an echo dot in their bedroom right now ring doorbells. Yeah. Yeah

51:04.320 --> 51:05.840
Stuff like that

51:05.840 --> 51:11.200
Okay, well, okay, but well do we see okay then do we see an advertising supported version of the ring doorbell?

51:12.000 --> 51:17.920
Every time you come home. It's like watch that 30 second ad welcome home courtesy of you know moors

51:17.920 --> 51:24.960
Well made well priced well dressed like a freaking. I don't know I noticed your your outfit is looking rather tattered today

51:25.440 --> 51:32.240
Yeah, you should check out more. Have you considered getting a haircut? You know great clips down the street is running a promo right now

51:33.280 --> 51:38.000
We we noticed uh that you didn't take a lunch this morning. Would you like me to order some food for you?

51:38.320 --> 51:44.480
Like honestly though like that was supposed to be how digital assistants like alexa and and

51:44.960 --> 51:48.000
Siri I guess to a lesser degree. I don't know what apple was trying to do with siri

51:48.000 --> 51:54.960
But how alexa and how google assistant and how to a lesser degree, but certainly significant degree kortana

51:55.200 --> 52:00.240
That was supposed to be the whole point of them. They were supposed to make revenue through advertising

52:00.240 --> 52:05.600
We were supposed to shop by just telling alexa. Hey, uh, i'm out of tide pods my kids ate them

52:05.680 --> 52:11.440
Can you order some more but maybe in the ones that taste like dog poo so that they won't eat more of them or whatever, right?

52:11.680 --> 52:14.160
Like it was supposed to be very conversational

52:14.800 --> 52:17.520
Um, and it just never really happened

52:19.120 --> 52:27.200
But this is how they do it they get a second or a third or a fourth generation of this is loaded to the gills

52:27.680 --> 52:33.840
With you know machine learning hardware in it so that it's like really understanding what it's seeing it doesn't just see

52:34.240 --> 52:36.160
it understands

52:36.160 --> 52:41.440
And is linked together with all your echo dots and all your security cameras and everything and they're basically just

52:42.080 --> 52:44.080
telling you where to go

52:44.240 --> 52:49.040
Asking you if it they can order things for you a future rama predicted ads in your dreams

52:49.120 --> 52:51.600
I hopefully we're pretty far away from that but

52:52.960 --> 52:57.760
Okay, let's see. I I I feel like it's borderline forced watching stuff

52:58.160 --> 53:04.720
Um, we've talked about that for a bit like ads in in vr and ar experiences, especially ar experiences

53:04.720 --> 53:07.760
Um, if ar glasses finally ever

53:08.640 --> 53:10.960
Get sleek enough that they take off

53:11.520 --> 53:12.720
um

53:12.720 --> 53:14.720
I feel like ads are going to be a

53:15.600 --> 53:19.360
Horrible version of that experience by the way, I saw a funny that I want to make sure I mentioned

53:19.440 --> 53:21.120
It's way gone now

53:21.120 --> 53:25.760
But someone mentioned that they think the main reason why you wouldn't mind this tv is because you wouldn't see the ads anyways

53:26.320 --> 53:30.720
Um, I thought that was pretty good. I thought that was pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I'm into it

53:31.280 --> 53:33.280
Yeah, kind of brutal but

53:35.120 --> 53:37.520
People are gonna take these so like

53:40.080 --> 53:42.080
Yeah tablets, I mean

53:42.160 --> 53:46.320
They're already monitoring everything you do on your tablet. I guess the only difference is that it could actually just

53:47.200 --> 53:49.200
Outright have the camera on at all times

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
ads in near a link

53:54.880 --> 54:01.040
Okay, I take back what I said, maybe the commercials and dreams are not that unrealistic. Yeah

54:01.920 --> 54:03.920
Oh, man

54:04.160 --> 54:06.160
It comes just using that. Yeah

54:08.320 --> 54:12.880
I'm high and just trying to enjoy tech bro talk and this is making me physically ill

54:15.680 --> 54:17.680
Sorry bro

54:17.920 --> 54:20.160
I'm actually sorry. I didn't mean to get all

54:21.440 --> 54:26.720
Uh, all of all of processor. Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get all amped up about this

54:26.800 --> 54:29.680
I know you're trying to relax right now. I was gonna get paranoid because you called him out

54:30.000 --> 54:35.920
No, no, no, it's not he's feeling very seen right now, man. No, no, it's not like that. It's not like that. Yeah, everyone's

54:36.480 --> 54:38.720
Okay, look everyone who's just trying to like

54:39.600 --> 54:47.360
Lay back and relax and chill on a friday. I'm so sorry. I hope you enjoy watching your your brand new telly

54:47.760 --> 54:54.160
Um, yeah, um you can now own for zero dollars. Have you considered shopping at cannabis dispensary dot com?

54:54.160 --> 54:56.160
I

54:59.440 --> 55:04.400
Is that a thing I don't know probably I don't I don't know what I just referred people to

55:05.600 --> 55:07.040
um

55:07.040 --> 55:12.640
Okay, apparently someone's just just camping that domain. So that's probably good. Yeah, that's probably for the best

55:15.760 --> 55:18.800
But yeah, I don't know like yeah, what's the difference nothing

55:19.680 --> 55:22.400
It's just another one of those things that I won't get for the same reason

55:22.400 --> 55:26.160
Why I don't have a bunch of echo dots and all this other type of stuff, but like

55:26.880 --> 55:29.040
At the same time I carry my phone on me

55:29.760 --> 55:38.240
Yeah, and I have a robot vacuum that has a camera on it. Yeah, you know, what's really sad is that the people who are going to be

55:40.400 --> 55:42.400
Predatorially

55:42.480 --> 55:46.080
Exploitatively whatever the people who are going to be marketed to so aggressively here

55:47.040 --> 55:49.040
Are the people who can't afford?

55:49.120 --> 55:49.840
Yeah

55:49.840 --> 55:54.080
To just buy the tv because this isn't a concern for me

55:54.720 --> 55:57.920
I'm not choosing between having a tv at all

55:58.560 --> 56:02.880
And not having a tv right like if my tv broke I would just

56:03.920 --> 56:08.480
Pay for it to be repaired or pay for a new one. I don't this this is not

56:09.040 --> 56:12.640
This is not cutting my life into pieces my last resort

56:13.280 --> 56:15.680
suffocation, you know, no breathing, right?

56:16.080 --> 56:18.080
Like I

56:21.360 --> 56:23.360
Anywho

56:23.680 --> 56:26.640
But for a lot of people it's not an option

56:27.120 --> 56:28.880
They're they don't have

56:28.880 --> 56:32.080
$500 and something like this could be really

56:32.720 --> 56:40.640
Appealing and I guess what I what I just what I fear for is that it's going to cost them more than $500

56:41.600 --> 56:42.800
You know, it's an interesting thing

56:42.800 --> 56:46.960
It says if it's expensive to be poor if users opt out of data collection

56:47.120 --> 56:52.320
Yeah, they'll have to return the television or have their credit card charged $500. What if they've already had their data collected for three years?

56:52.320 --> 56:57.440
I don't know it doesn't say yeah, if you just like don't turn the tv on

57:00.080 --> 57:04.720
Could they tell if you taped over the bottom screen like that's the type of stuff i'm wondering about like what if you had like

57:05.200 --> 57:10.560
A board or something sure that like covered it up. I guess you'd still have sound problems

57:10.880 --> 57:12.480
You have a mirror

57:12.480 --> 57:17.760
You have a black mirror you make it track itself. You make it. Yeah, you make the the camera watch the tv

57:18.560 --> 57:20.560
Let's see how you like it

57:21.680 --> 57:24.640
It does in the to s so wait it has to be plugged in

57:25.200 --> 57:27.200
What if you have like an extended power outage?

57:27.920 --> 57:29.920
wow

57:30.160 --> 57:35.760
Oh, i'm just trying to figure out like all the different ways people could abuse this thing that is unreal

57:35.920 --> 57:37.920
Could you piehole it? I don't know

57:38.960 --> 57:40.960
I don't know

57:41.520 --> 57:45.600
You really you have to have the internet connected to it according to the to s. Yeah, so they'll know

57:46.640 --> 57:47.920
That's wild

57:47.920 --> 57:54.720
It's pretty nuts. That's wild. Yeah, all of processor again in here with the real truths overdraft charges are worth millions of dollars a year

57:55.120 --> 57:56.720
That is disgusting

57:56.720 --> 58:02.480
It's actually really like charging people for having no money the first time I got charged for overdraft. I was like

58:03.440 --> 58:05.440
Why didn't the transaction fail?

58:06.080 --> 58:10.320
They they have that function. I know for a fact they have that function because I've seen it

58:11.200 --> 58:16.320
So how did I manage to take out 18 cents more money than I actually had? Oh 18 cents. No

58:16.720 --> 58:23.200
$20 and 18 cents now like oh my goodness ridiculous and for me it wasn't a matter of like I didn't have money or anything

58:23.200 --> 58:27.840
I just like I forget I like used the wrong I keyed in the wrong account or something like that

58:27.840 --> 58:32.480
Like this is when I was a teenager and I still managed my own finances, but I

58:33.600 --> 58:38.480
I was just I was like outraged. I was like, this is the stupidest thing ever. Well, it is. It's disgusting. Yeah

58:39.920 --> 58:43.840
35 it's 35 dollars when I was growing up the the

58:44.640 --> 58:48.400
Over whatever fee was 20 bucks. Yeah, I think it was like five or ten bucks when I was a kid

58:48.960 --> 58:50.960
$45

58:51.920 --> 58:53.920
That is just outright

58:54.560 --> 58:59.680
Predatory and should be illegal the amount is man the amount of stuff. We just need like a we just need

59:00.400 --> 59:02.400
Like a common sense council, man

59:03.440 --> 59:08.640
Like just are we massively abusing people that are having a hard time?

59:09.440 --> 59:13.200
If maybe we shouldn't do that. Yeah, if if no

59:14.080 --> 59:16.080
Okay, yeah, if yes

59:16.480 --> 59:17.680
then

59:17.680 --> 59:19.280
of

59:19.280 --> 59:20.880
and

59:20.880 --> 59:23.120
No, like I just

59:23.120 --> 59:24.320
Yeah

59:24.320 --> 59:25.600
Um, okay

59:25.600 --> 59:29.680
Now is the time for us to explain merch messages and I want to make it really clear

59:30.240 --> 59:34.400
Merch messages are for people who have the disposable income

59:34.880 --> 59:40.400
Not for people to be exploited. Don't go into your overdraft. Please. Please. No, please. No

59:41.280 --> 59:45.520
Uh, if you don't already have the money in your bank account to pay off your credit card for this month

59:46.240 --> 59:48.640
Do not use your credit card on a merch message

59:48.720 --> 59:55.520
But if you're in a good state and you're ready to go merch messages are the way to interact with the show

59:56.080 --> 01:00:00.080
Don't send a super chat. Don't send twitch bits or whatever. Send a merch message

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.840
Go to lttstore.com. Check out any of the awesome stuff that we have over there

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.160
Uh, do we have any product launches or anything like that that we need to talk about? Yeah, actually

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.280
Oh, we do. Oh, we have some cool new stuff. Anyway, I'll get to that in a second

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.120
But first you head over there and in the checkout you're going to see a box when we're live

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.160
In the cart. Thank you. You're going to see a box when you're live that will prompt you to send a merch message

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.080
That merch message goes to one of a few places. It goes to our producer dan

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.000
Well, actually it all they all go to producer dan then from there

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.360
Producer dan might reply to you and you'll see your reply down there

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.000
Or you might just see your message get pushed onto the stream so you can be like hi mom

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.840
Or like uh, hi other mom or whatever. It doesn't really matter

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:46.800
Or you might have your message curated and it'll be something that luke or i or luke and i or sometimes dan

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.080
Will also reply to during wan show after dark

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.880
We'll do a couple of them now just to kind of show you guys how it works

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.400
But first I want to show you what we've got on the side

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.840
We're launching two new products this week

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:07.120
And one of them is a pretty big announcement. Yeah, this is the official logo for ltt labs. Yeah, what do you think?

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.760
Uh, I actually I like it. It's subtle. You can you can you can just say you don't like it

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.680
No, I'm not against it. You can just say you don't like it

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.080
I immediately saw it as a heat sink because when gary and I were talking about it

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:22.480
He pulled out a heat sink and was like this is the logo and I was like what and then he showed me the digital version

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.600
I was like, okay, but then you wouldn't have known it was a heat sink. No, no

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.040
I see it as a heat sink, but people have brought up that it looks like a file folder

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.800
Like one of those things that like one of those like trays that holds files

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:41.600
Yeah, I guess so but I think with the context of having labs there. Yeah, kind of put it together. Yeah, I'm okay with it

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.320
Yeah, yeah, I'm just happy. We have a logo. Yeah, we finally have a logo. Which is sick

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.680
It looks really great in the gradient version

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.240
Which is not here. So cool. I guess you guys I can debut that later

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.400
Anyway, it's available in six different colors. This is a pre-sale item

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.920
All shirts will be printed following purchase. It may take one to two weeks to print and ship

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:08.160
Please do note this. This is highlighted. Now. There's no excuse for not noticing. Also. We've got the same thing, but

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.200
I'm aware. I'm aware. It's a small microcontroller heat sink

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.760
And we've done a little repeat of what we did when we did our first

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.560
Linus tech tips branded merch

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.160
So if you pick up the labs shirt or the labs hoodie

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.600
It is possible that we will reprint these in the future or that they'll be available on the regular

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.800
But we will never won't say first do another one with a hashtag first at the back

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.560
So really appreciate everyone for supporting this first merch drop for the lab

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.320
And uh our our mission that we're on here and now hold on just a gosh darn second here. Oh cool

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:52.400
You can change the text color logo color. Yeah. Oh, I actually didn't know we had that power. That's pretty cool

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.720
What else did I want to talk about? Uh, oh no books. Oh, no books are back in stock. Oh, that's awesome

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03.120
Those were out of stock for a long time. All right, let's do a couple merch messages. Then

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.880
I want to talk about

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:12.560
Hold them off. Ah, okay. Perfect. Perfect amount of teasing. Oh, okay. All right, Dan hit us

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.680
Sure. First up here. We've got lots today. Hi DLL

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.600
What's an example other than luke of someone you've hired for x-roll then discovered their veteran y-roll

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.800
Oh, I mean, I think that that didn't take long

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:31.760
Um, I mean brandon, uh, brandon lee was hired as an editor. Oh, was he? Yeah

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.440
I didn't know that remember he worked on the steel series set

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:42.400
He had his editing station up in the office upstairs at my house not at the Langley house, man

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.800
I forgot we had a steel series set. I remember all of this now. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.520
I honestly the list probably goes on and on realistically

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.040
I mean once you've had people for a really long period of time

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.120
It's not that uncommon that they'll swim through a few different sets of responsibilities

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.160
We hired colton for the business team and found out that really his talents were better suited for like waste management

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.320
janitorial

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.640
Yeah

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.040
Uh hit me again

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.440
Yeah, sure. Uh, hi lld. Congratulations on your retirement

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:27.040
What's your thoughts on the slow drop of the 40 series nvidia cards been waiting months for laptops in australia with a

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.440
4070 but no end in sight

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:36.640
Man, that's a that's a good question. I actually didn't know that there was a supply issue on 4070 based laptops

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.240
By slow drops, I kind of thought you meant maybe like the staggered rollout where they've launched the lineup

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.080
Sort of one card at a time

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.120
But that's pretty much par for the course for them because for nvidia

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.120
It's very beneficial to have people talking about them all the time

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120
I mean we found this on ltt store

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:58.560
One of the best things that I can do to sell more water bottles is to talk about a cool new shirt design

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.560
So you guys go. Oh sick shirt

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:06.080
Hey, well, I'm at it. I might as well throw a water bottle in since I got to pay the shipping fees anyway, so sick

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:11.680
Um, so that's that's that's nvidia for you, right? Like if they launch a new gpu. That's very competitive

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.560
It creates a new cycle where everybody's talking about it

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:20.240
And you know, oh, you're launching a 4070 ti, but you know what? I'm like I'm flush with cash

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.600
I don't want a 4070 ti, but if you make a good 4070 ti, I bet your 4090 is pretty good and you go buy one of those

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:30.320
Right, it's just beneficial for companies to you know, they say there's no such thing as bad publicity, right?

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.560
It's beneficial for them to be talked about constantly

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.560
So that's why you're going to see this slow roll

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.920
They kind of drag it out for as long as they can and at every at every stop at every product

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.040
There's the announcement and there's the unboxing embargo and there's the review embargo

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.920
And then there's the announcement of a game bundle that we're doing and then there's the new feature that we've

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.920
Said we were going to do but now we have actually enabled so they try to keep this communication going constantly, right?

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:03.520
So that would be why they do that as to why there are no 4070 laptops and stock in australia

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.000
I would say it's probably because australia is really far

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.640
I was just going to say I think that's probably more an australia specific issue. Yeah

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.320
Yeah, all right. Give me one more dan like internet

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.120
With your stepping down will sponsorships be changing at all e.g

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.360
vetting products and companies or discontinuing them in situations like anchor

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:30.880
I would expect not like I said the well, okay, so here's something that not everyone I think fully understood

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.800
is the the reporting structure between me and taren is

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.160
Kind of weird, right?

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:48.160
So everybody everybody on the pyramid on the in the organizational chart reports into the chief executive officer

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:56.800
Including the cto the cvo the c whatever o all the all the c-sweets everyone below there ultimately reports to the ceo

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.760
So I report to taren and he can tell me what to do

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.200
Day to day

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:09.200
But oh go ahead. I see I find this easier to understand because it's something I had to kind of wrap my head around to at one point

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.440
As there being two linuses

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.400
Sure

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.200
There's employee linus and business owner linus. Yes

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:24.000
So that's the thing, right? He's my boss and he can tell me what to do on a in a given never mind a day in a given week

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.080
or a given month even

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.240
but then

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:31.840
They the ceo works at the um

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:38.080
Yeah, sure at the at the behest of the shareholders and the directors so

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:44.880
I am the principal shareholder and I am one of only two directors of the company the other being

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:52.080
Yvonne and so taren when it comes to executing on our vision for the company reports to us

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.920
So on the one hand he's there as a check and balance to make sure that I am not

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:03.680
screwing things up on a daily basis with respect to making sure that this place runs smoothly to kind of

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:10.640
You know slap me if I am if I am doing something that is you know really detrimental to one of the other departments or

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.360
If I am you know training people in a way that's incorrect or whatever else to help us

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.080
To help us operate better, but not just like chief operating officer like to help us

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.320
To help us execute on on bigger picture things than just what a coo would do

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:33.600
So if he were to say like look, I I think our our best use of our investment is going to be to start a system integrator

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.680
Let's say hypothetically

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.120
chief vision officer

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:42.240
I want a plan for how we're going to differentiate how we're going to market this thing

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.720
And what that's going to look like

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:51.760
But then he would have to come to me above him and say I want to spend two million dollars

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.480
Starting an si. Here's the plan

01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:02.160
Um, and here's how we're going to market it which like I gave him so he gets to say he gets to present

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:06.480
My presentation to me and then you get to pick yourself apart. Yeah

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.880
There's some weird loopiness

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.040
Yeah, and I do think that this is going to work

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:19.520
Really well and the main reason for that is that you know, I've worked with terrin longer than I've worked with

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.160
Most of the people here

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.280
And that's something that I feel there was a lot of anxiety about

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:31.840
Even from members of our current executive team because they didn't really they didn't know him, right?

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.400
To a lot of people who's coming in as an outsider

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.680
There was a lot of anxiety, but I think

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:41.200
I've been doing some thinking on this as well. I think that was good

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.160
I think if we were just all like, uh, sure that would have been like kind of stupid

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.680
Well, I would have I would have told you guys you're being idiots because that's not due diligence like it was right for us to question it

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.160
I I

01:09:54.560 --> 01:10:00.240
Here's a bit of a curve ball. Yeah, I mean throw not a super major one. I'm ready. I uh

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:07.120
In in like a weird way, and I don't know if you're ready for this or not. I know you're bad with compliments

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.440
I'm proud of you for doing this. Oh

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.240
um

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.280
Yeah, yeah, because I think thank you. I think

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.640
We both have this kind of tendency to just like be down to just like carry things

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.040
And you've been carrying this for way too long

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:34.800
And I know you have a hard time letting go of things too. Mm-hmm. So I feel like this was probably very difficult

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.360
It's been a rough week. Yeah

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.880
Honestly, it's been a rough long time. Yeah, you know, um

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.720
So like I'm I'm proud of you for actually

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.600
Being willing to do the thing that needed to be done to solve that problem. I was forced because that's tough

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.160
Okay, not by a person

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.760
But there are worse ways you could have dealt with that. Sure

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.800
I don't know what I would have done if he hadn't taken the job though. Yeah

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.800
because

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:13.680
While I definitely wanted and I solicited feedback from our leadership team about this hire

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.680
um

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.120
I wasn't

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.120
That open to alternatives

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.880
That's a that's one way to put

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.040
There was no option for alternatives

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.160
Well, I mean, I even told I even told Taryn this as part of the negotiation process

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.880
He's like, well, what's your job offer? And I'm like, look, I'm gonna do that complete like

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:45.360
Thing where I make you pitch me. You you yeah, you tell me. Yeah, you know how I always I always do that

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.840
I'm the worst, right? I'm gonna so you tell me

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.520
and

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.720
Here's the thing

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.720
Either your pitch is gonna make sense

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.560
And I'm gonna say

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.400
Yeah, you you are able to see the big picture

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:06.080
Even considering your own personal gain and do something that is balanced and right for both the company and yourself

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.960
Or you're gonna pitch me something that sucks and I probably shouldn't hire you anyway

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:15.840
Those are the only two outcomes. So no, this is this is actually your first test

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:23.760
Yeah, is to tell me what your compensation package should be like why and why yeah pitch it to me because your entire job is going to be

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.840
pitching shareholder Linus on expenses and

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:32.960
And management and why what you're doing is in the best interests of the company

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.000
So prove it and like obviously, you know

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.120
His response you f***ing, you know guy, right?

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:44.560
A little bit, but also I think he understood where I was coming from because if we're going to have that level of trust

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.240
And we're going to be able to communicate that openly. It has to start from day one. It can't

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.280
Can't just be it can't just be random

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.600
and so

01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:00.880
The reason that I wasn't really that open to to and I and I told him to as part of this this very open communication

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.200
I was like, yeah, I'm making you do this

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.400
But the reality of it is I don't have any other candidates and I'm not really open to them

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.360
So you have me over a barrel

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.400
But let's see what you would do with that. Are you gonna deal with this properly? Yeah. Yeah

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.240
um, and the reason that I wasn't really open to

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.440
Other options even though like obviously we could have posted a job listing

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.440
What I don't post on indeed, you know, I'm hiring a ceo for a media company. So I don't know

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.280
But

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.520
That wouldn't have changed my day-to-day. I wouldn't have been able to let go

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.920
I I would have had to

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:46.240
I would have been looking over this ceo's shoulder because I don't know them

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.080
I don't have that relationship and like I said earlier on the show. I'm not

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:54.240
I'm pretty antisocial. I don't want more friends

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.680
Like I joke a lot about how I have more. I have no friends

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:04.240
But the reality of it is I actually don't design to I actually don't want them. I'm tired. I don't like talking to people

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.800
and so I would have to I

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.400
I'd have to like build a relationship with this person and like

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.560
Build this rapport and try to achieve this like mind meld

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:21.120
And it's so much easier to just hire someone who already is the person who trained me to

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.080
To be the the business mind that I am

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.120
as it were

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.680
And so I know would make the decision that I would because the only reason I do what I do is because they told me to

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.600
Um, I had a lot of people question

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.800
Um, you know why we didn't hire from within

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.720
and

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.320
It's a really good question. I think that there's a lot of potential

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.560
for people to

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:54.240
Be upset both externally and internally. I'm pissed. We didn't even you know post

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.840
We didn't even give anyone an opportunity to apply for the job internally

01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.520
um

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.960
But and I mean this in the kindest possible way

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.320
Nobody internally was even close to qualified

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.080
Sorry that just

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:16.080
I'm sorry. I don't think that's entirely those people's fault. No, it's not. Well, where's their mentorship?

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.840
I know you're not saying that I'm saying that for the audience to be super clear. Okay. Um, yeah, but that's totally true

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.680
Like where has their mentorship been? We're a really young team too. Yes. Like we do not have people

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.480
I'm the adult in the room

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.800
What the f**k?

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.080
And when we're talking about like these situations where like, oh

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.080
You you don't necessarily realize you need to create a knowledge base article for something

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.440
Um, and then you don't necessarily have the time to do it afterwards and stuff

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:50.080
Like we're coming from that and you're expecting this type of like it's just it hasn't been there. Yeah, it's tough

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.160
um

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:57.120
So we we actually do post new positions internally under normal circumstances

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:03.600
But this was a something that was you know, kind of a private matter for me in in a certain sense and be

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:07.760
Something that again, like no offense to anyone. They just weren't

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.520
Weren't right for the job and I'd love. Yeah

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.600
Uh, jay taylor said uh, I always feel like luke, uh, wouldn't want to be the CEO

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:23.680
I could see myself being interested potentially at some point not now

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.400
For a multitude of reasons one

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.400
I feel like I have a lot of unfinished business with the teams that I currently run

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.960
and by having that

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.040
role change I would have to kind of like

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.960
Leave them which does not feel right and two I'm not ready. Anyways, do you have a lot to learn? Yeah

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:46.640
I mean, it's it's always really funny for me when I hear my own words coming out of luke's mouth

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.800
talking about like

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.520
Some strategy that he used to talk to his team or like

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.880
And but like there's still a lot like I I understand because I'm not stupid that there's a long road of that ahead of me still

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.760
so like and the thing is that

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.200
I'm not really qualified to take you down that road

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.320
That's a big part of this too is I don't have that much real-world work experience

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.200
Like think about that and we're like this is the one thing that like I guess I'm still

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.080
I'll be uncomfortable about this

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:23.040
For a while and that's just going to be a reality is linus slash avan

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:29.360
Which I'm considering one unit or person right now. That's how we see it. Yeah. So that's fine

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.960
Has been my direct report for 12 years

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
effectively my entire

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.080
realistically professional life

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:44.080
Because everything before then was like temporary jobs if I'm being honest and I think that's that's going to be a big change

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.760
But I will also say now having spent time with taren

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.720
I'm interested. Yeah

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.640
And yvonne and I have a lot to we have a lot to give we actually do have a lot to teach

01:17:54.720 --> 01:18:00.720
She has management experience coming into this. I have experience coming into this and we've both learned

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.960
a ton

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:08.160
Just school of hard knocks. Let's go making our way through the last 10 years

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.960
But there's actually ways to do things

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.640
But you don't just make up as you go along and see what sticks

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:22.000
That's a lot of my stuff too. So like I I feel like I might end up having a lot of

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:28.800
Growth from this. Yeah, it's just gonna be it's a it's just it's a complicated situation and I

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.640
Appreciate the fact that we did that executive retreat thing

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.640
Because that I had talked to him a few times. Obviously I met him at the roast

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.760
I had respect for him from like knowing him back in ncx days very lightly

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:46.320
I think I met him like twice and just having having you talk about him meeting him at the roast all that kind of stuff

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.720
But being able to spend an extended period of time of like two days or whatever but still

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.520
was was reassuring because

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.760
The things that I care about in a person in this type of role is like

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.560
I mean, he's a human. He's gonna make mistakes at some point

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:06.480
But you could tell the way that he was approaching conversations and problems when we were at that retreat and he's probably watching this

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.200
So this is awkward. Um, but I could tell that

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.960
In the case where he makes some form of mistake or someone else does that he seems

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:22.160
Significantly more invested in trying really hard and solving the problem than like crushing people or whatever else

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.160
He's he's very like

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.800
Like game-minded. Yep. Like let's let's get this done. Let's do it in the best way and to be clear

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:34.800
He'll tell you when you f*** up, which is good. Yeah, one of my I wouldn't work very well with him if he didn't so like that's fine

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.720
Yeah, one of my one of my most vivid memories was when he told me off for

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.400
uh

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:48.880
Like telling a vendor some kind of like super internal information just like in a casual conversation. He's like

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.080
You don't talk about that. Like it kind of ran me through

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:58.320
Terse is a word that I've used to describe taren before. Hi taren if you're watching

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.760
Um, he's better about it now, which is really good. He was younger and fatter year than we all were

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.680
So it was definitely terse

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.440
but I understood it

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:16.400
And it was in the interest of the company doing better and me doing better. Yeah, and you got it. You got to respect that, right?

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.560
Yeah, so I don't know. I've got a couple good questions here that I've seen in the chat

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:25.280
Uh, one is hey, isn't that the guy who ran ncix into the ground? What are you doing hiring him?

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.600
No, I've had that same comment. I've had to make the same clarification

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.880
yeah

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:37.280
taren was my boss, but not the owner of ncix and actually taren was

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.200
A big part of if not the reason that I left

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.760
When they when what they should have what ncix should have done

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:53.840
Uh, well, man, how long ago was it? I guess, uh, about 12 years ago was they should have hired taren to be

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:58.720
Not if not ceo coo and given him the reins to run it

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.240
That would have saved it a hundred percent. I I really do believe that in my heart of hearts

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:12.000
I had some ideas and all of that but I was basically a kid at that point and I had good ideas like ways that that we could do better

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:19.760
Um, but I I didn't like I wasn't an executive. I'm not barely an executive now. I was certainly wasn't an executive then

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:24.800
He had the stuff he could have figured it out and instead they pushed him out

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:31.840
And I was like, well, this is ridiculous because now we've got like the inmates running the asylum essentially around here

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.400
None of the adults are left in the room. Um, it's time to start looking for the exit

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.160
Like it was very clear that the writing was on the wall as soon as they a

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:44.720
Uh, didn't recognize that they were in trouble and b

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.720
Couldn't hire the solution that already worked for them

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.560
Oh, wow, what is happening here?

01:21:53.360 --> 01:22:00.880
Um, so so no that is not what happened and then another really good question that's coming up a fair bit is why not yvonne for ceo?

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.600
um, a couple of reasons one

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.600
It's that's that ain't her jam. I was gonna say she wouldn't want that

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:15.280
Yvonne if she were to change titles from cfo would be the chief operating officer. Yvonne has such a mind

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.560
for um optimization

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.520
She is just the queen of efficiency

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:30.720
And aside from that she's she really loves solving problems. Um, and so operations would be something that she would totally just kick

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.640
out at

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:42.000
But the question is does she want the job and as shareholder she basically gets to decide what job she does sort of but also doesn't because she's a shareholder

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:46.880
And she just kind of needs to do whatever is right for the company and both of us have done that for a long time

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:52.160
And so while my transition is really public she may go through a transition that will be

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.800
probably less public but

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:59.520
Equally helpful for her. I think it's been a long time doing something that she has

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:04.560
Realistically no real no actual passion for which is like financial stuff

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:10.880
Um, so yeah, um, yeah, well, that's the thing. She can be good at anything. She just needs to she just needs to decide

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.880
She's good at it and it's like, okay, then

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.840
Like I can't do that. I don't have that power

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.760
Like i'm i'm really good at some stuff way better than her at some stuff

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.880
But she is way better than me at anything

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.880
Other than that's like a handful of stuff that i'm really good at

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.040
It's kind of wild

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:32.800
How she'll just like I mean look at that stupid short circuit video she did on the cricket

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.880
I gave her about 13 minutes of training in the car on the way to work

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.000
And kind of helped her put together like a skeleton for you know

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
What a script might look like and then she did the whole thing

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.640
It's got like 1.4 million views or whatever she has she has almost no on-camera experience

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.360
Her total on-camera experience is like maybe a couple hours

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.800
And like doesn't really like it as far as my understanding goes didn't mind it. Okay. She gets like kind of she doesn't like coming on

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:58.240
When that's the only she gets kind of self-conscious about it sometimes I think but it's just like

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.920
I don't know. I I tend to be kind of dismissive about it. I'm like whatever

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:06.560
You're like you're good at anything. So what do you like don't I mean want to hear it

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:11.040
You know, it's like oh, I got such a bad mark. It's like that's like way higher than my mark

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.320
It's typical

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.800
Didn't you fail out? I don't know how much that means

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.040
Ha ha ha ha

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.960
Um

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:29.200
Okay, should we move on? Yeah, we need to talk about a big ltt store thing here. Ah

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:35.040
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Check this out. Check this out now. Oh, yeah

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:38.160
Hold on for the sake of the integrity of our poll

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.120
Neither you nor I

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:46.080
Is going to is going to give any feedback on this one. We'll see if the poll works

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:51.040
Oh, what are polls broken? Oh, yeah, that might be. Oh crap. We know how to fix them

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:54.720
I don't remember. I don't think they're fixed. Oh, okay. We were a little bit more focused on

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:58.640
The massive update. Okay. Do you want to try to create a poll? I

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.920
I mean I can the poll is just option one option two option three

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.160
Uh, let's just okay. Yeah, sure. Okay. Go for it

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.800
Good luck everybody

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:18.880
We are finally ready to what is the question. What one do you want? Uh, yeah, which which one is best?

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.760
Okay, did it work?

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.560
Yes, well, okay, that's not the part that's gonna have a oh, okay. It's the speed at which

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:35.600
People are voting. Oh, and we know how to fix it. It's like not hard, but we've had time

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:40.640
Yeah, what I'm not surprised guys. Don't do that that

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:46.160
What are you doing? There's not that many votes. Okay. Well, let's not worry about that then

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.360
Okay, let's just yeah, there's a lot of people watching on float plane these days. Okay

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:58.560
We're finally announcing it the noctua edition of the ltt screwdriver in tan and brown

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.360
This is option one

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.520
This is option two

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.760
And this is option three

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.120
Okay, I don't want to I don't want to bias you guys

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.640
And and luke I actually have a couple of the options

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:21.440
Here in the studio here in the studio in person you can check it out. Yeah very

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.000
Very very excited for this. This is going to be freaking awesome

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.840
I mean it means a lot to me to collaborate with a company like noctua

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:35.440
You know how their standards are if they're willing to if they're willing to

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:39.920
Cross cross promote and and participate in something like this

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:43.760
You know, they got to absolutely love the screwdriver. So

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.840
Have a look don't really give a ton of thoughts yet dan

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.480
Do you want to man the camera and we can kind of show these ones off after?

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:56.240
Uh, I need to send a message. Um, oh, okay. Oh screw it. Yeah, okay

01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:02.720
Um, okay, he's I took it on the ground

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.840
Wow

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:16.480
Uh, I'm just gonna go ahead. I'm gonna I'm gonna not show the results here. I'm gonna go back to this

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.080
Uh, all right. So luke do you want to kind of show what you got there? Yeah, so both of these

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.800
um

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.280
So again guys option one option two option three

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:35.120
I'm trying to find that okay, so

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.520
This one is the most unique one. Is that correct the most unique one

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:46.320
Because there's I believe this one has the same color like, uh, I don't remember the name for the selector ring

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.880
And the whatever you call this

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.400
I

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:54.880
Mean I'm not sure what you mean by most unique one. That's called the end cap though

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.000
Okay, so end cap selector ring same color handle same color

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:04.240
And then the accent ring is um, I believe is that in there. Yeah, that's in there. It's matched to the body color

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.200
Oh, okay. So I was going to say this is the same but inverse as the other one and then this one doesn't have an inverse

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:16.320
Is that correct? Uh, yeah, that one follows the same kind of color scheme as the uh, like the orange one would with the accent on

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.400
The end cap of the accent on the accent ring

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:24.640
Don't don't give an opinion yet because I want I actually need, you know, true results here

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.360
Okay, well, um

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.520
Wow

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.160
What just we're gonna have to close the poll at some point and I was expecting it to be

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:42.000
Not this close. Okay. Don't spam in chat guys. Relax. Yeah guys

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:47.040
Chat does not is not where the polling happens the polling happens in the poll the poll

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:49.360
Yeah, we're not looking at chat

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.240
What are the option numbers again? One two and three. Yeah, okay, you're welcome

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.600
I will show you again

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:03.600
Okay, so one this one is one two and three this one is two and then the pictured one is three

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.040
Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're holding three in your left hand. Yeah, and then this is two and so one

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:11.600
I don't have yeah. Yeah one you don't have

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.920
Okay, okay, I'm gonna close the poll now

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:19.680
We are closing the polls

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.120
And let's see our um, yes

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.960
Yes, see that's the part. Oh, okay. Well, let's show the results then

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.440
option one

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.720
Whoa, wait

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.720
Oh, it just changed

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:38.960
Option one and option three are a dead heat 586 to 586

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.200
Okay, I don't know how to deal with okay. It's finished now

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.160
Uh, holy crap

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:53.920
Yeah, it's finished for you. I have never seen any poll this close for anything we've ever done

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.360
Option one one

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.840
But by only two votes

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:03.920
Literally point three percent of the vote

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.400
um

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.200
Okay

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.200
Do we need to do a runoff then

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.320
We can does it happen to be that

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.600
Okay, no, you know what

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.400
I think this you know, I think this is enough information for us to go back to

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:27.680
Noctua and kind of figure this out then. Um, either way. Okay. What do you think now?

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:33.040
Do you want me to show you all three again? Yeah, okay

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.360
I will say

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:39.840
I don't feel like super strongly about it. Really? I think they're all pretty cool

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.400
Um, I think

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.920
This one

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.720
So option two. Yeah, and option

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:53.120
Not this one are probably my favorite option two and one. I think it is or my two favorite got it

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.760
Yeah, you know what's funny is I think this is one that I just completely

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.960
Didn't nail um

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.920
I liked this one. I like yeah, I like that one or or option one personally

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.320
I

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:12.080
Do you have a do you think it's not white, but do you think that color would?

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:18.160
It might show it might show stuff. I just thought it looked way cooler. Um

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.040
But people are more into the they're more into the brown body on it

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:29.600
Yeah, like all right. Okay. And you know what I I think I just I think I just lost uh

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.760
I think I just lost a bet because noctua objected pretty strongly to this one

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:37.360
Is that is that is that the one that I didn't I wasn't really watching the results much

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:41.920
Is that the one that this one lost lost and the other two

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.640
Um, we're basically tied. We're

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.360
Functionally even yeah

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.840
So

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:53.280
I guess we'll see we'll have to work it out with not to a which version of this

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:56.160
People are saying there was a thousand votes before we even showed the options

01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:00.000
Do you want to rerun the poll? Do you want to rerun the poll with just two options?

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:06.000
No, I'm not too worried about it because when I looked earlier on before I actually showed the options the poll was

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:11.360
Fairly even and two was actually winning. I think so and then it kind of inverted

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:16.800
So so if people threw away their vote they threw away their vote, but like that's that's voting for you. Yeah

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.440
That's kind of part of the system

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:26.880
Eventually like when we can work on things that aren't incredibly important. I do want to have ranked choice voting

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:30.640
Yeah, I think that would be sick. Yeah, it'd be super cool. But not now

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:34.640
All right. So there you go guys the noctua screwdriver

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:40.640
Is officially announced. We are working with noctua on what exactly the color scheme will be

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.240
That's the detail that we're kind of going back and forth on right now

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.000
It's not like actually viewers choice like noctua needs to have input and all this other kind of stuff

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.040
They do need to have input. Uh, I mean worst case scenario

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:55.680
We just do a brown and tan screwdriver and they're not involved. I guess. Haha. Yeah

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:57.680
Um, I mean that's

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.920
Oops

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.240
What?

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.840
Oh

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:08.400
It's gonna say that's what we're doing for some other stuff. Oh, don't worry about it

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:16.880
I wonder how the new ceo is gonna treat leaks. Yeah

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:24.480
Well, he won't be the first person to yell at me about the way that I just talk about stuff on wandshow

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.960
Let's do a couple more topics. You want to pick one?

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.840
Sure

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.800
Uh schools are struggling with ai as the academic year ends

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:40.480
American schools are approaching the end of a full semester with widespread access to ai chatbots and ai enabled cheating has been

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:47.440
Predictably rampant especially now because a lot of schooling a lot of your grades are kind of like end of term or semester

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.360
weighted

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.080
So it's gonna be a bigger project, you know

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.640
Yeah, one big project one big final stuff like that

01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:02.240
It's unclear to what degree this is an actual increase in academic dishonesty because like are more people cheating

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:05.440
Or is it just more rampant for the people that are cheating?

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.840
Or is it making a bigger impact or something like that?

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:18.320
Cheg a tutoring service widely criticized for allowing students to buy the answers to homework and also tests has told investors

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:22.880
That chat gpt has likely damaged their ability to attract new customers

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:28.960
The company has since lost one billion dollars in market valuation. This happened a while ago

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.880
Isn't it wild that?

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:34.800
Like a test cheating company is worth any billion

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:38.400
Yeah, like the fact that they could lose that much is like, well, okay

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.560
Kind of nuts uh complicating matters. How can students? No, seriously. No. No, I want to come back to this for a second

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:48.000
How can students with the tuition they're paying afford?

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:50.960
cheating afford answer sheets

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.360
or wait

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.360
How can they afford not to cheat?

01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:59.120
Yeah, it might be they can't repeat this course and it might be more time effective

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.120
Like if you just don't study but go to work, right? Okay. All right fair enough

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:10.640
I got it now complicating matters plagiarism and ai detectors are imperfect and the growing number of different ai models has

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:18.400
Dramatically increased the number of false positives and also negatives less technically sophisticated educators are prone to accepting these results

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:26.480
At face value including is this one? Yes. Okay. I'm happy this is in the dock infamously a texas college professor recently

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.800
accused all of his students

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:35.040
Of using I thought it was like half but anyways of using chat gpt to write their essays

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:38.960
Leading to over half of them being held back from graduation

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:45.520
The professor had not used an ai detection tool instead. He ran the essay through chat gpt

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.840
Which claimed it had written them

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:58.400
Because ai hallucination because it just like it was just like oh that seems neat. Yeah, sure right on like

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.440
Sure, it's not designed for that at all

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:07.840
I did that while a 100% ai generated essay is clearly cheating and I'm gonna paraphrase you for a second

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.880
We've seen a bunch of examples of this of teachers showing

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:14.160
Uh, like halfway through an essay it'll be like now

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:18.240
I'm not entirely sure it's certain about this because I am an ai generated model blah blah blah blah

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:24.480
And they catch people with that which is kind of hilarious. Um, they don't even read it. That's awesome. Okay brutal

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:32.080
Uh, while a 100% ai generated essay is clearly cheating more nuanced uses of ai like using a chatbot to help generate

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:38.480
Ideas and reword awkward sentences can and sometimes do get flagged by anti cheating software

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:43.120
The same may happen if a student simply writes in a highly predictable manner

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.840
reminiscent of ai

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.640
Yes, bruce. I am still happy with it

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:52.880
Don't worry about it. Sounds good. Uh, there's a discussion question

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.360
Should schools be responding to ai?

01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.000
Also, why do porn bots still no good at the talk?

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.200
Yeah, okay

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:09.760
Have you noticed this? Have you been on youtube lately? Yeah, you see them in the comment section. No, you can't see anything

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:12.160
But pun intended them

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:13.600
like

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:19.280
Honestly, it's at the point now where again, I am asking you once again youtube

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:27.280
Do something like if if if a handful of people that just have asses in their profile pictures

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.920
But our real people end up getting shadow banned

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:35.360
That's a price i'm willing to pay at this point because we cannot just have

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:42.720
I I I sent my I sent my youtube rep just like a screen recording of scrolling through the comments on one of our videos

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:48.000
And literally 90 percent of the top comments within like an hour after it had been released

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.840
where these like

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:55.040
Come have tap to have sex with me like porn bots and i'm sitting here going these are

01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:02.240
These are very easy to identify. I haven't seen any of the whatsapp scammers anymore. No, they've they've just shifted

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:10.880
So clearly youtube has the capability to ban every possible iteration of whatsapp from usernames

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.120
So do the same thing

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.600
Why does anyone need?

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.680
a luscious ass

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
In their profile picture

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.040
It's not necessary

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.960
What if the what if they're what if they're a hot tub youtuber?

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360
What if that's literally part of their brand?

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.080
Then they'll be verified there done. Okay

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:34.960
Or they can what if they're on the

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.400
Or they can apply for an exception. I don't care figure it out

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:46.080
Figure it out should be a way to apply and figuring it out needs to involve just getting rid of this if you have to over correct

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:48.640
Over correct. It's ridiculous

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.440
Why do you have to

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Why do you have to use the word luscious?

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.440
I thought it was good. I thought it was funny

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:02.080
And like yeah, it's it's bad though and they they sometimes I will say

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:06.400
Uh, they they and this should potentially even be easier to detect

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.720
But I guess there'd be a lot of false positives here as well

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.440
But they'll they'll copy other people's comments

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:16.000
And just post the same thing. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen that a lot. That's pretty common. Yep

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:22.080
Yeah, it's super like to me the biggest thing is just like and I understand this is easier to do with with

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:25.040
Human eyes and comprehension, but we'll see how long that lasts

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.320
Um

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:32.080
You scroll through and you see the user names and it's just like this is so obvious and like half

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:40.080
The fact that it will take many months to like pattern detect this stuff is just like what like the whatsapp ones like come on

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.640
Didn't uh, didn't theo joe make something for that. Yeah, what's up one?

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:50.000
Yeah, like better than youtube's this shouldn't take community efforts to solve this stuff

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.320
Like man, I don't know and it's frustrating because like on the one hand you've got google doing, you know

01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:02.800
They're google io keynote all about yeah ai this and machine learning that and use it. I'm yeah

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:09.760
Turn it on. Yeah, what why can I still like this? This is why this is why you're you don't call hofman wong

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.640
Sorry

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.280
Who do you want to call?

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:17.520
hofman wong

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:23.920
Sorry, i'm not finding a match in your contacts. Tell me just the first name or feel free to use the screen

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:29.280
Feel free to use the screen. That's not a solution

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:36.480
I this is this is to say i've been ragging on google for a while for like

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.440
It's literally yeah

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
It's literally it's just hofman wong

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:49.520
It's it's not like he nicknamed it or anything like that. It's just hofman has two ends exactly that which is a legitimate spelling of hofman

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:50.720
yeah

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.720
And it's like

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.120
I'm sorry, I don't have a number for evan home

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.160
I understand you absolutely shouldn't have to do this. So i'm not using it to i'm not saying this to defend it

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.900
One thing i've done called james strybe

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.080
Sorry, who do you want to call?

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.880
james strybe

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:23.680
Sorry, no one in your contacts. Sorry. I'm not finding a match in your contacts. Tell me just the first name or feel free to use the screen

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:30.880
Feel free to use the screen. How about this? How about I only have one james in my address book call that one?

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.600
I

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:41.680
Nickname I put people's like an identifiable nickname that I will remember as people's first names and then their

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.040
First name is their middle name and their last name is their last name. That's a stupid work around. I shouldn't need

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.520
I agree the year is now present year

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.240
And that should be entirely unnecessary

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:58.960
Absolutely, it should have phonetic whatever cashed of everyone in my address book and it should just use that

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.280
because

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:04.320
Holy s***. How is it not already doing that? Yeah

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:10.400
And so I I don't even remember the other thing we were talking about that they were useless at

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.400
I was just saying like in general like the fact that they haven't

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:21.040
Applied this stuff to deal with comment moderation. Oh, yeah comment moderation. That was the one that like whole core concept

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.040
The fact that they haven't done that

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.320
You can extrapolate that into entirely why they're losing ground on like everything that they do. Yeah

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:34.240
They just they're just not shipping. They're not acting. They're just sitting

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:38.160
It doesn't work. It's frustrating people are gonna come steal your lunch

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.800
Anyways moving on

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.040
Imgur, Imigur

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:47.280
Imgur, I think I'd Imgur

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.360
Imgur, uh gif gif

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.840
I feel like it's one of those things last month

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:59.600
However, you say it announced a ban on nudity and sexual explicit content as well as old unused or inactive content

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.760
That is not tied to a user account

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:06.880
Um, also known as a bunch of things from Linus the the changes took place on May 15th time

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:11.040
It was not one time. It was not one time three times

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:17.840
Maybe more. I used to use uh sharex or what was the one I used before that? It was a similar tool push

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.000
I think it was yeah push push push super cool

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.880
Anyway, uh sharex was the one where I started uploading to Imgur

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:28.320
I think but I I used to use sharex to just anonymously upload anything that I would screenshot

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:31.600
Only if I screenshotted it with sharex like explicitly

01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:38.960
Um, and then I would just get it would just automatically take the the the link to the file you copied and put it on your clipboard

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:41.760
so you could just quickly send things to people and

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:47.600
One time I send luke confidential information in a in an image thing

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:53.840
And he's he like freaks out. I'm like without the context. No one's even going to know how important that is. It doesn't matter

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:56.400
It shouldn't work that way. It shouldn't work that way

01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:01.600
Anyway, so anything that someone like me ever uploaded. Yes carry on. Yeah. Yeah

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.280
Um

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:06.080
The changes of this stuff took place on May 15th

01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:09.120
But it will likely take some time before all the images are deleted

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.480
The purge of old and anonymous content is likely to destroy

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:18.160
Countless images embedded on other sites across the internet including reddit. We're hosting on Imgur

01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:23.920
Uh was the standard method of posting images from 2009 2016. That is true. Another thing. It's probably going to

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:30.000
Ravage is the count to 10,000 thread in the bronze section on the forum, which is sad

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.760
Oh, yeah, because there's tons of

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:36.080
Imager embedded images there. Yeah, that's a bummer that actually kind of sucks

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:41.680
Because it's kind of funny to go. Yeah broken broken image links in forums and stuff photo bucket

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:46.800
You see just like the the the skeletons of old photo bucket and it's like man

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:50.000
This would have been a really cool thing to actually be able to go through and read

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.680
It's almost like this isn't a viable business model and you're an idiot for doing it

01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.760
Thanks vcs when they take big money from ad

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:04.880
Providers to put malvertising ads on their site, which they've done like a bunch of times at this point

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.960
Maybe they do make some money, but I don't know

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.800
They do show like if you see some picture or gift or whatever

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:12.480
There's a way on

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:14.720
Imager to see how much

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.160
Like how much data it has taken to serve this image and some of them are like, whoa

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.120
Like it's a gift that's been like

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.320
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of gigs worth of data transfer for this one gift

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.040
It's like, yep, that's rough

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:38.560
The administrators of something awful forum have taken on a more selective effort to back up every imager link

01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:44.880
Embedded onto the forum during the last 14 years. Wow the forums. Uh, I don't think we're gonna do that

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:49.120
Yep, shawty not the forums owner who goes by jeffrey

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:55.920
Okay, uh has stated it's clear we need to host our own images websites promising that they'll host your images for free

01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:58.080
Are never going to stop running out of money

01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:05.760
It's nearly impossible to monetize a site like that a good deal of the modern internet is treated as transient and

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:11.520
Okay to delete whenever and that is a real shame if anyone is to ever look back on our society

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:14.800
They won't be able to understand it without understanding the internet

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.360
I'm

01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:23.920
Yeah, that's gonna be true regardless notably the something awful forum has paid membership and more resources than many other websites

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:32.560
That makes sense. How do we retain the popular history of the internet? Are we doing enough? I don't think we can maybe some of it should just die

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:35.360
Interesting. Well, that's a hot take

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.200
Wow

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.560
Do go on

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:42.640
I don't think that everything no matter what

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.520
is worth saving. I do think

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:50.960
A massive volume of stuff is worth saving a huge percentage

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.640
But there is a bunch of like just transient stuff on the internet that does not need to be safe

01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:00.960
We don't have to save every single thing that ever happens in the digital world

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:06.880
But are we gonna lose the stuff that was important and end up keeping garbage? That's that's a concern

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.120
Yeah, that's a big concern. That is a big concern

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.200
Oh

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:17.200
That's rough

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:23.840
Yeah, it's hard to say because like we were like we were talking with those photo bucket links, right? Yeah, like there's there's old threads

01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:25.840
which like

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.600
it actually

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:30.000
Has pained me to come across them and be like, man

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.480
Like this was a big deal

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:37.600
I've probably been to this thread like a ton of times. Yeah, and now these photos just timed out and

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:42.240
This is basically useless and now that we don't actually write anything down physically

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.440
You know, let's say you were trying to do let's say you were trying to overclock an old cellar on 300 a

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:56.240
And all the images for which pins to jump or on the motherboard or whatever. We're on photo bucket or a non-account

01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.360
Imager say right because that would be happening now

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:04.720
You'd lose that that's brutal like there is I'm not saying there isn't stuff that's worth

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:08.800
Save there's obviously oceans of stuff that's worth saving. Yeah, there's also a lot of

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:12.720
But like repair repair guides and stuff didn't used to be video

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.200
And there might be like you're talking with the old cellar on it

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:20.400
There might be old repair guides that like it's for something that very rarely breaks

01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:23.200
Yeah, but you can't get new ones or for something

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:25.920
That's rare and very few people know how to deal with it

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:32.960
And there was that one resource that everyone leaned on in order to calibrate that crt or whatever it is right because for every

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:38.240
For every forum thread that you find when digging for something old where someone's like

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:44.160
Oh, I'm having issues with these things and then no one responds and they just reply. Oh, I fixed it and it's like

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:46.400
Oh, man, why don't you tell me how?

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.040
There's there's a bunch of other ones

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.200
where they do

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:54.240
And losing that because a ton of that information is in pictures

01:48:54.480 --> 01:49:00.800
You're talking about like this bios screenshots. Whatever else it could be. There's there's lots of pictures on the internet

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.800
There's tons. There's tons of useful ones

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.280
Hey, thank god. We're still gonna have tiktok

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:10.400
As long as we don't live in minnesota or whichever state

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:17.440
Abandoned or something happy wag. So this would be a good reason to fund libraries. Well, there is so I I do agree

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:24.560
And there it's libraries are one of the libraries libraries are one of those things that are just kind of constantly changing

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:30.320
Constantly evolving. Yeah, and this might be one of the ways that they do that

01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:36.000
Yeah, unfortunately the way they're evolving right now is not getting funded. So that's probably not going to happen

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.160
Yep, uh calturn

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:41.600
Sorry montana. Is that right? I don't know it was someone

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:45.360
Um calturn says convert the moon into a huge cloud server

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:51.040
The zero atmosphere would be excellent for cooling and there'd be plenty of room for all that data problem solved

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.520
Okay, there's a few issues with your suggestion

01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:56.000
Uh number one

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.920
Okay, getting servers there very challenging the moon is actually above the cloud

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:07.040
Number two zero atmosphere is actually not good for cooling

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:12.560
The air is what takes the heat away

01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:20.640
Um problem number three plenty of room. Actually, you're right. There is plenty of room. There's a lot of room. Yeah

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:28.400
Yeah, if you don't mind your server getting hit by like little asteroids and stuff. Yeah, so solid effort calturn

01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.080
Um and no, well not just that right because without an atmosphere

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:38.560
There's a lot more radiation from the sun which is really really handy if you don't like having your data. Yeah

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:45.760
Because that radiation is just going to start flipping bits all over the place. Yeah, so what we could do I guess is uh

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:50.000
Build a moon base. Yeah. No. No. Well, it would have to be a mobile data center

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:54.480
It would have to be on like treads so that it could stay like on the dark side

01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:58.160
Oh, there's still there's still a lot of just like passive radiating. Yeah

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:05.200
It's not a real solution luke. No. No. No, we're doing this. Why are you gonna pick a chart? We put trance on the moon and it just constantly

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:09.760
It just constantly rotates. No piercer at the server

01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:17.600
Amazing. Okay float plane chat actually has this solved. We just put it underground on the moon

01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:25.200
All right. Good call. Good call. Good call. We do we do all the cooling geothermally. We can dig with nukes

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:31.760
Right, we can nuke the moon. Is that what we're saying? I don't think that's a good idea

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:35.920
This is a reference to Elon Musk wanting to nuke mars for terraforming

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:45.600
We need to nuke everything we need we need to nuke mars. We need to nuke the moon

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:50.320
Pluto's too far if we send a nuke on the other side and hit it back

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:56.000
Come in closer. That's great. We can nuke. We can nuke pluto. Just nuke everything

01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:03.360
Sponsors

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:08.960
Yeah, why don't we talk about that? That that would be good. Is denis back to do fund sponsor spots yet?

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:14.240
Unfortunately, no, that's fine. Why don't we tell you about our sponsor zoho one?

01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:19.440
Do you own or manage a business let zoho one make your life easier?

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:22.000
How long does that guy get to be on vacation for you? It doesn't matter

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:30.000
A zoho one takes the essential elements of any business like accounting marketing and hr and combines them into one unified operating system

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:35.200
Build your own website from the ground up and maintain it with intuitive customization and personalization options

01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:39.200
You can send out purchase orders create marketing campaigns manage shift scheduling

01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:42.800

To be clear because some people kind of missed it. That was not actually a commentary on the viability of various terraforming options. We're just

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.800
laughing about things, okay

01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:14.320
Gotta be careful what you say around nerds speaking of laughing google releases new dot zip and dot m o v

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.040
Yeah, um

01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.040
That sucks a lot. Oh

01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:26.560
Whoops. Sorry dan. Yes merge messages. No, wait. What he's moving all the signs around dan

01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:32.000
Well, because you were off the rails. What are you doing over there? You didn't listen to the piece of paper. Okay. We'll do it. We'll do it

01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:34.320
We'll talk about that later. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:40.160
That's okay. I can follow you hit me with a merge message. Okay, uh, sure

01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:44.960
Uh, let's see. What plane chat still talking about the stupid moon thing. They really are

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.760
I still think we should snow piercer the servers

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:53.760
Good evening l l and d. I've been watching servers with nukes. Can you stop?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Can you stop

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Good evening l l and

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:06.000
I've been wanting to nuke the moon for the last stop. Oh, I'm not supposed to show that dashboard

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:08.720
It does it every time

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:14.960
I've been watching on float plane out. I was wondering if it mattered if I finish a video or use the like option

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:23.440
You still use the data for getting sponsors, etc. Nope. Nope. We sure don't it doesn't matter. We suck at um, no offense

01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:27.200
You suck at collecting data from viewership

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:31.600
So the good news is that we aren't leveraging it in any way

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.760
Yeah, if you were worried that we're selling your data, you can rest assured. Nope

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.880
We are too utterly incompetent to do that

01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:43.680
Took the words out of my mouth rough rough rough

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:50.000
I'm kidding. Um, the new ceo the the chief vision officer just brutalized me

01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:59.120
He could it okay, it has not been a priority Linus has asked for it for a bunch of times and I just said no, um, there's the

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:04.080
There's more important things for us to work on it's true

01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:08.400
There is there is certain amounts of that data where if you like actually wanted it

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:11.440
We could get it for you and it's like never been even worth

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:20.160
Going in grabbing. Yeah, it's like, I don't know usually I the way our conversations often go about things like this is I'll I'll come up with something

01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.800
I'll be like, oh, hey could we is there any way for us to take, you know

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:30.000
everyone who's posted about their ltt merch on the forum and send them a

01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:34.720
A coupon code for a month free of float plane and luke will be like

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:42.240
Technically that but and just by his tone. I'll be like forget it. I'm over it

01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:50.400
Yeah, or he'll tell me oh, oh no one of his favorites is to tell me what project will be delayed by it

01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:57.360
Yeah, well if you don't want, um, you know playback resume on the float plane site then

01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:02.960
Yeah, we could have that for you in x amount of time. I'm like, I'm over it. That's that's like my favorite thing to say

01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:04.800
I'm over it

01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:08.960
I'm clearly not over it because I'm bringing it up now not that that that is a new idea

01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:11.600
I'd never had that idea. That's a pretty good idea though. It's not a bad one

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.480
But I mean like you just said it would it would delay some other form. I'm over it. Yeah

01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:22.480
And like yeah, it is possible

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:28.960
There's there's there's a very very very large amount of things that are possible when you have a bunch of developers and engineers on your side

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:35.200
Yeah, it's just like is it actually worth doing and are you considering the opportunity cost? Right? Yeah

01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:38.160
Look at this guy all responsible opportunity cost

01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.560
All right, here's another one

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:54.720
So which came first Linus planning on stepping down a ceo or luke getting promoted to cto or were they basically concurrent? No

01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:01.760
Well, don't forget. Hold on. We've got the timeline a little mixed up first luke was demoted from ceo

01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:06.240
Then he was repromoted to ceo or hired as ceo

01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:13.280
Tio see. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. And and actually it's like only even sort of true because neither time was it actually real

01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:15.920
I mean

01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:18.880
So

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.880
He got the cto title

01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:26.480
So he was hired as cto then he was fired as cto hired to a different company as the cto

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:33.760
C. Oh, oh, then hired back to linus media group as the cto. It doesn't matter the point is he's luke

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:38.560
Yeah, he wears this shirt. I just do stuff. He's adorable. Yeah. Uh, I like that. I like your shirt

01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:41.440
I think so

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:50.800
What time is it? Is it getting is it getting to giddy hour? I think so. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah, 840. That makes more sense

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:56.560
Um next merch message. What is this? Why can I get rid of it? Sure windows? What are you doing? I don't know

01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:00.160
I'll give it a dan. See you later dan. Bye. Oh, sorry. How come I come back dan? No

02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:06.800
Linus, are you anticipating? Oh, no, dan's gone. Oh Linus. Are you? Oh, he's gone anticipating

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:10.640
any

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:12.720
potential

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:16.320
I hate it

02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:28.560
This is so much fun, uh, okay, we're uh being professional is hard. Um, are you anticipating in the porn industry?

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:32.320
That's even more important Linus

02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:34.320
I

02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.920
Should have waited for him to take the drink. Why did I wait?

02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.280
That's going away for now. I think this is a dangerous time

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.600
Okay, I can't do this

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:52.480
Linus, are you anticipating any potential turnover? Hope not as a result of the ceo change

02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:58.000
Can you give a scenario or explain when you or avan would override a decision by the new ceo?

02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:05.680
Oh, wow, you're getting into the big like ceo Q&A. Okay. I am planning a float plane stream about this sometime in the next little bit

02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:08.560
Um, so I'm not going to avoid every question about this

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:13.120
But I'm also not going to be able to address every question you guys have about this now because I kind of want to

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:16.160
I kind of want to be in the right headspace for that

02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:21.520
But I will tell you that I am not expecting really any turnover

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:25.680
Honestly, the reception to the move internally has been really positive

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:28.080
I think the people that know me well

02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:30.560
Uh, probably knew that

02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:36.240
Whether this was coming or not. I needed this at some point. Um, and the people who didn't know me well

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:39.200
What difference does it make? I don't know

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:44.720
Well, and there's also like I think a lot of people especially internally recognize that

02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:50.800
Uh, people only have a certain amount of hours on day and having you do the thing that you're best at probably makes sense

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:54.400
Like it's pretty logical when you break it down. Yeah, I think so

02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:57.840
You

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:05.920
Sure, I lost count. Yeah, we got a lot. Uh, how you do it over there?

02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:10.640
It's fine. We are not going to be able to do them all today guys. Absolutely not. I'm so sorry

02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:16.480
Picking up lab shirts because those are freaking awesome. Oh my god. Don't forget to get a water bottle while you're at

02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:18.960
Oh, man, I should leak an upcoming water bottle design

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.520
I feel like that might be under the the vision, you know, yeah

02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:33.760
I had a vision of a water bottle. Yep. Um, so it's it's just like brown or black. I think are the two colors

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:35.360
and

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:41.440
It just has like a white stripe down the side with like the v's or the o's or whatever and it's a big capacitor

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:49.120
Oh my god, I would buy that immediately. That is excellent. That's kind of sick 10 out of 10. Yeah, could you uh vision officer?

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.520
Yeah, very good sweeping changes. I'm so excited

02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:56.480
So sweeping changes is the new water bottle design

02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:03.200
I would love one that had like the bottom blown out and so it didn't like sit on the table like it's a burst cap

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:05.360
Oh

02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:09.440
I mean, okay, you could just do that yourself though. All right. Yeah

02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:14.480
Yeah, or or or you could not screw the lid on properly and then it's a leaky cap

02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:16.480
Yeah

02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:20.720
Perfect idea get it because it's a leaky cap too man so many meanies

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:24.800
Dad joke king

02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:26.880
Inception of water ball over here

02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.080
All right. Okay. Here's another one. Uh

02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:35.920
Oh man float float plane chat. So no, no, no, you should put gatorade in it. Then it's electrolytic capacitor

02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:40.480
If you put tin foil in it, it's a foil capacitor

02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:42.480
Wow

02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:47.600
Endless

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:49.760
Okay

02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:56.240
Hey ldl, uh, given the cards like the 30 90 and 40 90 exist with more view. Hold on. I'm not done yet

02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:59.120
I'm not done yet. Everything dan said no cap

02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:04.240
That one hurts

02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:08.480
Okay, right that's stomach. We can actually do another one now. I'm sorry

02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:15.360
Given the cards like the 30 90 and 40 90 exist with more v-ram than most systems have d-ram

02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:18.080
Is it possible to run an os on a gpu?

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.360
To my knowledge, no

02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:23.360
Yeah

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:27.120
However with that said, I mean if you okay, hold on a second

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:34.400
Something something rebar direct storage something. So I I actually don't I actually don't think so though

02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:41.840
Um, I mean nothing would prevent you from using someone in float plane chat is very passionate about saying that it is

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:44.720
It that it is possible

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:46.880
And they have a link and they're spamming the link

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Okay, all right, let's see

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.560
Linux in a pixel shader

02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:54.960
A risk

02:04:55.120 --> 02:05:00.160
Cr chat. Oh, yeah, uh shader tech is nuts. It's just nuts

02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:02.720
Whoa

02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:06.640
Okay

02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:09.680
Fine

02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:11.840
Apparently yes

02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:13.840
I I just want to say that

02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:16.160
Katra the person who posted this

02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:18.400
was

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:21.440
On it like I don't know this this must have been like

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.720
Literally the tab that they had open at the time like I feel like we were on a side monitor

02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:33.200
Yeah, and they were reading this because they were like it is it's possible and then the link's there all like boom boom boom boom boom

02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:37.760
That was that was wild. Thank you for the the speedy uh response

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:43.040
Okay, enderman apparently managed to get windows 10 in VRAM and used it as a boot disk

02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:45.440
That's not really the same as like

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:48.240
Running it as your system memory though

02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:51.120
So I don't know

02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.200
Okay. All right. Good job

02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:54.720
Um

02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:57.200
That was that was impressive. Are we supposed to do more topics now?

02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:03.280
I yeah, I think so. Okay, google new dot zip and dot mov domain extensions

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:07.760
Google released eight new internet domain extensions most have been uncontroversial

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:12.640
But two are being criticized to their for their similarity to existing file extensions

02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:17.200
Dot zip and dot mov in case you were wondering which ones they were

02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:21.520
Uh, the concern is that users especially less technically savvy users

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:27.200
Maybe maliciously uh tricked into clicking on a web link. They think is a file and vice versa

02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:32.160
I think even fairly technically savvy people are going to get owned by this because like

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.200
Unless you read the whole domain, it's not necessarily all that obvious

02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:42.080
I think google's justification for this tld is

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.360
phenomenally stupid. What is it?

02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:48.160
I'm trying to find it

02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:54.080
Um, it's like this is going to be a problem 100% dot mov

02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:00.720
I'm having a hard time finding it. It's not in our it's not in our links here

02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:06.720
Man, how are you even gonna like look at this? How are you even gonna search for anything google dot mov

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.880
Justification what like what even is any of this? This is nothing

02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:14.000
This is ridiculous

02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:19.120
Yeah, if anyone has a link that talked about it was something to do with like dot mov was supposed to be for like

02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:26.080
Like the moving moving pictures or movement and dynamism or something like that. It was just it was just

02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:29.440
Stupid

02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:31.520
And I just couldn't

02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:39.040
Uh, I'm trying to find the like I'm trying to find the example because it's not just

02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:47.520
There it is boom. Okay, uh my laptop do it. Here we go. This is the issue

02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:51.520
So you see github.com, right? So most people

02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:55.840
Uh, most current internet users are gonna read this and be like, okay

02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:02.400
This is the website that I'm going to it's github.com and then these are the pages that it's jumping through, right?

02:08:03.120 --> 02:08:06.880
So the dot zip at the end here traditionally would just be a file

02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:09.280
Right, so

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:14.560
Theoretically you jumped through these various pages and then you clicked on a file and you could share this link to someone

02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:19.440
And if they clicked on the link, it would just download it. It wouldn't actually direct them to the page, right?

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:22.080
That's how that's how things have have worked for a long time

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:28.800
The problem is now because of this at character as far as my understanding goes and someone might

02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:35.440
Correct me on this, but because of that little I've highlighted it here. Yeah, because of that little character

02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:37.600
That means what you're actually going to

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.720
Is just this

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:43.280
Oh, so you're going to one dot zip

02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:46.240
Uh-oh

02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:48.240
Yeah

02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:48.240


02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:50.240
Big oh

02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:52.240
So like

02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:56.240
I haven't seen things like this personally, but like that's that's

02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:01.600
That's rough now. So like you everyone's going to have to like sniff their freaking

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:04.560
URLs for this little at symbol

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:07.600
And like that's

02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:13.440
That's this is why I'm saying like the whole technically savvy thing doesn't even really fully apply because I don't know pretty much

02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:15.760
Anyone that looks for that right now

02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:21.840
So unless you're you'd have to be technically savvy and also paying attention to the news which doesn't necessarily

02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:26.800
Coincide with each other now. Do you want to hear why they did it according to ars Technica? Sure

02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:33.440
Google marketers say the aim is to designate tying things together or moving really fast

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000
And moving pictures and whatever moves you respectively

02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:45.200
For dot zip and dot. I'm it's frustrating because I don't f***ing stupid. I go after google on this show for just not doing things

02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:47.200
But then the second that they do something

02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:49.840
I'm always just like, oh

02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:53.840
I'm always just like, how did no one look at this?

02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:58.000
Like it's either they move like no one saw this and we did it

02:09:58.800 --> 02:09:59.840
Or

02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:05.200
They never do anything like there has to be an in-between. How did no one see this as a problem?

02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:08.880
You can't just release dot zip domains like

02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:12.880
I don't

02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:19.680
This is so frustrating because like I can absolutely see someone at this company getting tricked by this

02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:22.720
You know what and then like it would be really hard to

02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:27.520
The dumbest part is that they know

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.320
Obviously about the association

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:38.400
Why would anyone other than a highly technical person tying things together dot zip has anything to do with

02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:40.720
togethering anything

02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:42.720
yeah

02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:45.920
And dot mov really moving pictures

02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:51.440
Is this just an f you to apple like what was the point of this?

02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:56.240
Really

02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:05.120
Okay, I don't really have anything else to say about that

02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:09.120
Really?

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.640
Okay, yeah, and like I need to read on this more and I'm sure there's some like weird nuances and stuff

02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:16.240
But people are going to go owned

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:19.120
This is going to be a problem. This is going to be a cyber security problem

02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:25.040
A bunch of different it teams around the world are going to have to educate their users on

02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:28.160
checking for at symbols because like it it means

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:34.880
Something about URLs are so long. It's not even practical, especially with the way that browsers abstract the url these days

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:40.000
Like it's and trackers and all this other type of stuff like and you're gonna have to hunt for this little at symbol because

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:42.720
And you'll have to hunt for it in like a mouse over like

02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:44.720
pop-up

02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:48.000
Hyperlink freaking what what are they called tooltip?

02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:52.800
You have to hunt for it in like a tooltip or something because the text doesn't necessarily match the hyperlink

02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:57.200
Remember the old days of the web that domain. Yeah, honestly. I bet you a massive amount of companies

02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:00.880
They're just going to block these domains anyways, which means they're going to be stupid and useless. Sorry

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:05.360
Oh, yeah, we should do that. Yeah, we definitely. Yeah, I was going to say the old days of the web before you actually had

02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:08.160
Hyperlink schedule me a message

02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:12.640
What you need I need we need to block dot zip and dot mov from ever being accessed

02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:15.840
Like it was maybe maybe it was possible. I don't know. I was a kid

02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:20.560
But pretty much any link was the actual like full url

02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:25.920
You didn't just have hyperlinks that you would click on all like some other text or whatever. Yeah, like so

02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:29.520
This I guess might be this would have been fine

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:35.760
Maybe then when it was normal for browsers to display full URLs and for the text to contain a full url

02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:41.760
And then honestly training everyone to look for those at symbols is weird because like and and as far as I know that

02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:46.640
That's already been a thing because it means what's before the at symbol is your username, but

02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:55.920
But I do think that if people saw dot zip at the end of it and they weren't expecting to be downloading a file

02:12:56.240 --> 02:13:00.320
That would be something that they would sniff out easier and because the dot zip is at the very end

02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:04.880
You look at like the beginning and you look at the end and you kind of know what's going on

02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:12.880
Now being able to just slap this at symbol somewhere in the chain. Yeah, and then it's like oh man. Yeah, I hate it

02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:25.360
All right, let's jump into toyota exposing a real-time location data of two

02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:28.160
million drivers

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:35.920
Two million drivers toyota has disclosed that it accidentally left the real-time and historical car location data

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:41.920
Of over two million japanese customers exposed for get this nearly 10 years

02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.600
According to toyota the cause was a misconfigured database in late 2013

02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:53.600
Which was set to public instead of private and it could be accessed without any password or credentials

02:13:54.320 --> 02:14:00.640
There's no current evidence that anyone outside toyota discovered and accessed at the database. That is completely

02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:06.480
meaningless unless they have like logs running and stuff which they might not because apparently they set their database to

02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:08.800
public anyway, so yeah

02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:12.400
That's a very interesting way of saying that

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:22.480
I mean, no, it's it's not completely meaningless if if the data showed up on the dark web or something

02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:25.360
That would be evidence that someone looks for it. Well

02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:30.720
That's my issue with this statement. Is it completely relies on them doing something

02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:32.720
I think a leak this big would have

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:39.360
Would have someone else would be talking. I think someone else would have talked about it. They may actually have dodged a bullet here

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.920
Boy, was it a big bullet though? That's not even a bullet anymore. That's like

02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:47.760
That's a planet nuke. Yeah, nuke you and your nuke son

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:52.400
You know what forget it. I'm tired. I resigned as CEO

02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:55.440
Ha

02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:02.400
Toyota discovered the error in april and has promised to audit and improve their cloud security

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:05.680
This is the third security mishap. They've disclosed in the last 15 months

02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:09.200
Things happen, but that's a pretty bad thing to happen

02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:15.040
A watchdog says that roblox doesn't protect kids from irresponsible after

02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:19.680
Really roblox doesn't protect kids from irresponsible advertising

02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:23.360
I thought roblox had kids best interests at heart

02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:26.880
This is like those scientific studies you find

02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:34.000
When they're like we have found through rigorous study and years of research that not going running

02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:39.280
Makes it so that you will run slower over time. It's like oh thanks. It's like come on

02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:43.520
Geez, this feels like one of those like I don't actually a lie

02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:48.320
Over a long enough period of time you will definitely run infinitely slower

02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:52.240
Just

02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:54.560
Yeah

02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:00.240
Oh boy, um, but yeah, like I I can't I can't imagine that anyone was like, uh, yes

02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:03.920
I believe roblox is the absolute best arbiter of like

02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:09.440
Not exposing children to bad things. Um, like like

02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:16.400
What was it got people confused about that because over a long enough period of time eventually you'll be dead and you're running

02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:18.480
You won't be able to run anymore. Yeah. Yeah

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:24.000
Um, there was something about like kim kardashian finding that that special video of hers

02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:29.920
Her her kid like saw it on roblox or something. I don't remember if that's like 100 true or not

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.360
But I remember reading something about that. Um, which is rough

02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:36.560
Karu karu

02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:43.680
Caru a children's advertising watchdog has released the results of an investigation that found roblox has widespread issues with

02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:49.520
Advertising targeted at children under 13 according to karu, which I'm going to call it now

02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:50.800
I don't know if that's what it is

02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:58.320
Roblox does little to ensure that influencers on its platform disclose product endorsements and affiliate commissions in a way that children can actually

02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:05.920
Understand, I mean, I can tell you right now based on the limited understanding that adults have of sponsorships and

02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:08.800
Affiliated and how all these things work

02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:14.640
Kids almost certainly have absolutely no idea that they're being marketed to yeah

02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:20.320
Uh further roblox's user created games often fail to disclose advertiser content

02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:26.960
This is not the first time roblox has been criticized over its permissive attitude towards ads targeting children a different watchdog

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:32.320
Truth in advertising made a complaint to the fdc over the same issue in april 2022

02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:39.760
Parents groups and investigative journalists have likewise criticized roblox as a haven for fishing scams and other financial crimes

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.800
Targeting kids again a lot of them have credit cards attached

02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:46.720
There are payments in the game right you can buy robux or whatever they're called

02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:53.280
In response to the fdc complaint roblox has recently announced a new advertisement policy

02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:58.320
Which will require developers to identify advertiser content in games directed at children

02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:02.400
The company has likewise agreed to caroos, caroos, whatever

02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:08.000
Uh recommendation that they require influencers to use the word paid in ad disclosures

02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:18.080
I actually don't think kids that play roblox that I can't even read and I don't think paid is actually necessarily the best ad disclosure

02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:22.880
Why not ad or am I not sponsored? That's what everyone literally everyone else uses

02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:28.320
Um like it's paid a common hashtag for sponsored content

02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:32.080
Am I missing something here?

02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:40.000
Whoa six of three in float plane chat says I have a friend whose kid has a $100 per month roblox allowance

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:47.280
Why that sounds like a mistake. I'm not gonna tell you I parent your kid. I don't even have one, but that sounds like a mistake

02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:52.480
Yeah, it sounds like training them to have bad habits like actively

02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:57.600
Okay, devil's advocate. They're budgeting at least

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
It's a fixed budget

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:05.680
But it's a fixed budget of a lot of blowing

02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:09.680
A lot of fixed budget on roblox

02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:14.480
Uh, yeah, I don't really like that so much. Um

02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:19.440
Yeah

02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:22.000
Everything I hear about roblox is just like bad

02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:28.320
Like I you hear you hear about like the massive take they have from their their uh

02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:35.760
Content designers slash developers because there's people that like make games in roblox, but there's also people that make

02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:43.280
Um like visual equipment. I don't know what you'd call it avatar stuff cosmetics cosmetics. There we go. Got there got there eventually

02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:45.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:46.880
um

02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:48.880
So I yeah, I don't know

02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:50.960
$100 of robux

02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:54.000
Is a lot of robux. Yeah, that that's the thing that's getting me

02:19:54.480 --> 02:20:00.400
Is like maybe if it was like a relative maybe if it was at an amount where they might have to save up for things

02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:05.360
Yeah, that's probably the but I play I can and like I'm sure there's some stupid

02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:10.560
One of three rare hat or something that's way more than a hundred dollars

02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:15.440
But like I can't imagine there's a lot that they actually have to save for when their allowance is

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:18.080
More than like I spent on games a month

02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:26.400
Like yeah, and like luke wastes money on games. He bought this stupid fucking game slap shot rebound the other day

02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:29.040
Is it free? It's a free game

02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:35.760
We we were actually looking at a different hockey game and picked the free one. Yeah, it's pretty fun. It is actually pretty fun

02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:40.080
It's very hard. We're both terrible. Yeah, it's really really hard

02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:45.680
Yeah, we man. We've actually played like a few hours of slap shot rebound in the last like few days

02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:48.480
I kind of wish we had footage of when we started compared to now

02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:54.640
Because I've seen both of us do like actual combinations and like plays and stuff now at the beginning

02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:56.960
we'd just like

02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:02.640
Slide towards the puck and rotate the wrong way every single time all this garbage

02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:06.080
Yeah, luke has no idea how expensive things are in robux

02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:12.400
That is true because I have never played and I deeply don't care or want even to know but

02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:16.800
You don't need to buy those

02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:22.800
Like I don't know come on. Yeah, just because something is there doesn't mean it needs to be purchased

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:25.680
Um

02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:32.000
Yeah, our discussion here is to what extent is the cavalier attitude towards advertising to children unique to roblox

02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:38.720
Uh, I don't even think it is like I think we had this conversation a little while ago where I was talking about taking my kids to the arcade

02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:41.120
And just realizing how much

02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:45.120
gambling conditioning was going on just training these kids to

02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:48.960
Put thing into thing and big flashy lights come out and they get a prize

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:51.040
That's worth a fraction of the money that they put in

02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:54.160
Mark robert did a really great video on how

02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:59.200
games of skill at arcades just like on the carnival midway are

02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:06.000
Not actually games of skill at all and are just completely games of chance and designed to steal your money

02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:15.520
It is it is amazing to me that that is allowed to exist. It is actual children doing actual gambling

02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:22.640
Yeah, I we talked about this on wancho too before about how like sports betting

02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:27.040
Is such an endorsed thing now where it was like a hush hush don't talk about it

02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:30.960
Yeah, when I was growing up and now it's like the main advertisers for

02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:33.760
these places at all

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.440
um

02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:38.320
And it's it's kind of weird driving around here even

02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:41.200
And it's like the casinos just seem to be getting

02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:43.200
bigger

02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:48.320
Uh kryptonite says it's not gambling if the game is rigged. No, it is gambling if the game is rigged

02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:50.720
At least if it's a game of skill

02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:52.560
it's

02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:54.240
Not a gamble

02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:56.240
almost every

02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:58.240
Way to gamble is rigged

02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:00.400
well

02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:05.040
It's not always house. Oh, okay. Okay, but the scales are definitely

02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:06.800
leaned on

02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:12.800
Um, what is the definition of rigged? So like you are to lose without expecting you are to lose

02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:19.680
Rigged means that no matter what you do the outcome is ultimately up to the machine

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:24.160
So something like a slot a slot machine is rigged

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:27.600
It will only ever pay out based on

02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:29.040
profit margins

02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:33.360
What it's what it's supposed to do but like roulette there's too much chance involved

02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:37.840
So even though the house is going to win over time the odds favor the house

02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:44.160
But there's actual odds whereas a the the fact that anybody puts money into a digital slot machine wild

02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:50.240
At least if it was a mechanical like an analog slot machine, you know why they want digital slot machines guys

02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:53.280
Hello

02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:59.600
Easier to control the outcome. Hello. Yeah, um, but an actual they still they still to be clear with mechanical ones

02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:04.400
They still control the outcome. Yes, but it's a lot easier when it's digital. Yes

02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:08.400
Um, so so the the example in the one that I watched

02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:13.040
He proved that that one where the light goes around the thing and you have to press the button

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:18.160
Oh, it's not a game of skill. Oh, you can actually change the programming in the game

02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:24.240
He found the manual he dug up the manual somewhere and you can just dial in how much you want it to pay out in tickets

02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:28.160
That's annoying. Yeah, because I always felt like no, I was pretty sure I got it

02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:35.520
And so he made a thing that within point zero one milliseconds or within one millisecond would press it at exactly the right time

02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:37.520
he made a robot and

02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:39.760
It would just it would just make it go past

02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:43.440
Yeah, it was like no more accurate than if they just hit it themselves because at the end of the day

02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:47.760
It was not about how accurate you were. It was just about how much it wants to pay out. That's so frustrating. Yeah

02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:57.440
Someone says a slot machines apparently have payout requirements and are in fact random. So great. Why aren't we regulating?

02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:00.400
Children's games the same way

02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:03.360
It's it's wild to me. Also, man, I don't know

02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:09.040
I don't know with how with how much skis there is in the in the casino industry

02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:17.040
I'll believe it when I see it. I'll believe that I'll believe that a slot machine is actually working exactly as it's supposed to be

02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:22.400
I'll believe whoever was supposed to check it didn't get a payout for sure when I see it. I don't know man

02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:27.120
I just I'm not much of a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist kind of person in general

02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:30.320
But when there's that much money moving around

02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:41.280
I'm sorry. I'm just not going to put my money in the slot machine. It's not going to happen

02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:43.840
Yep

02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:45.840
It's so boring too. I don't understand

02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:48.720
That's that's like a preferential thing. I guess but like wow

02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:53.760
Yeah, if you want to throw throw away money to like see flashing lights and stuff just play peggle

02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:56.320
Yeah, um

02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:59.200
Valve finally big enough to be sued by immersion

02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:04.640
Immersion corporation has launched a patent lawsuit against valve over the steam deck's touchscreen and rumble feature

02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:08.640
Immersion began developing touchscreen and haptic feedback technology in the 90s

02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:12.640
But since the 2000s has primarily become known for its many lawsuits

02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:17.600
In 2002 microsoft opted to buy 10 of immersion rather than fight their suit

02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:22.560
While sony had to pay immersion millions after losing a suit over the vibration feature of their controllers

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:28.480
Apple, google, motorola and fitbit have all settled with immersion while meta is currently in litigation

02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:34.160
The steam deck notably doesn't use the same rumble technology that sony lost over erm actuators

02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:40.720
One of the few major gaming companies that hasn't been sued by immersion is nintendo whose rumble pack technology

02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:43.040
predates immersion's patent which

02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:46.000
Raises questions like how did immersion get a patent on it?

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.280
But anyway immersion did not sue valve over the steam controller

02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:52.640
Though this is most likely a reflection of valve's growing popularity and success

02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:56.960
Um discussion question should valve take this as a compliment

02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:01.920
I mean, I guess that's one way of looking at it

02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:05.920
I'm sure they would rather just not have to deal with this lawsuit from a patent troll

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.600
So frustrating how much innovation gets squashed by this crap

02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:12.640
Hate it

02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:20.080
What I don't hate is announcing the ocbase slash occt 20th stableversary

02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:22.800
Hey

02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:29.360
It's a stability testing software that's been around for a while. They're celebrating their 20th anniversary dubbed a stableversary

02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:35.760
They've revamped their site and software and to celebrate they're hosting a giveaway with total pricing valued at 10,000 us dollars

02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:43.280
You can win all-in-one coolers cases motherboards fans racing sim equipment occt licenses and a gpu and ltt store is sponsoring

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:47.040
Some of the prizes for the giveaway with screwdrivers tech sacks and backpacks

02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:51.040
Go to ocbase.com slash stableversary to enter the giveaway

02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:54.480
And I think that's pretty much it for the topics this week. We had a couple other things

02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:57.680
We were kind of thinking of talking about oh the asus router issue

02:27:58.080 --> 02:27:59.280
So that was bad

02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:04.320
Uh asus what pushed like a firmware update or something like that that basically knocked every asus router offline

02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:11.600
Yeah, a security update as far as I know. I didn't dive super deeply into it. But yeah sick. Yep. Uh, there's some like nerd drama

02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:13.280
Um

02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:19.120
Between nerds. Yep. Um, you know what? I don't know a lot of this. I don't feel like talking about that. I'll talk very

02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:24.400
Shortly about the overwatch 2 thing. Um, oh, yeah, so

02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:29.200
What's up with that you what you just promise a campaign and then just never deliver it

02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:35.520
What you just you know promised halo co-op and then just don't ship it or what like I just who do they think they are

02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:38.320
Sorry, but what we're talking about is annoyingly common

02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:41.440
Jeff Kaplan the

02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:46.480
Pretty fantastic video game designer. Hopefully hasn't done terrible things. I don't know whatever

02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:50.640
Um, Jeff Kaplan announced the single player

02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:56.400
Um, basically everything Jeff Kaplan worked on was like awesome. Um, so people were really excited

02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:00.480
Have you clarified that this is for overwatch 2? Yeah. Oh, okay. Maybe not. I don't know

02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:05.920
Yeah, he announced it announced single player stuff and like hero mode and all this other type of stuff going on

02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:13.200
With overwatch 2 and they have effectively announced recently that it's a lot of work working on single player and multiplayer

02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:16.640
And they're just going to keep working on single or multiplayer. Sorry

02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:21.680
Hero mode's not coming etc. Etc. I don't play overwatch

02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:25.280
So there might be some elements of it that got partially there

02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:27.440
I don't know. I haven't dove far enough into this story

02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:30.080
But I know a lot of the things that people were excited about

02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:32.560
They're not coming and Jeff isn't there anymore

02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:36.320
So he can't make it happen and that was one of the reasons why it was nice

02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:40.240
When he was around was because he would kind of make those types of things happen. So

02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:45.440
I had a bunch of interest in overwatch 2 because it was supposed to have co-op

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.040
And this is something that lioness and I have talked a decent amount recently

02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:52.080
Where it's like you look at the games that are killing it recently

02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:54.880
They're all single player games

02:29:55.680 --> 02:30:01.040
Basically the ones that I can think of and yet the games industry doesn't want to build single player experiences. No

02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:03.200
They're like, oh, we're gonna make a bunch of games as a service

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:04.160
We're gonna make all these other things

02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:10.000
Yeah, we want to make a game that you literally play with 100 of your time for the rest of your life one game

02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:16.800
I don't want that. No, I want to play tiers of the kingdom and then have tiers of the kingdom be over

02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:18.720
And I want to play something else

02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:24.240
I don't want tiers of the kingdom to be slightly different if I log out for six months and log back in

02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:28.400
And it's like exciting when you do that because then when the next one comes out, you're like, oh cool

02:30:28.480 --> 02:30:31.920
I get to go through a similar experience again. This is one of the reasons why I like

02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:37.520
Uh getting people to play the titanfall 2 campaign because it's like six to eight hours

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.520
Okay, I really do still need to do that

02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:43.840
But like I wasn't even trying to rag on you for that, but it's just like it's it's a good

02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:48.400
Like I beat it and then the next night I beat it again

02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:51.520
Because I played it on the hardest difficulty

02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:54.720
What a chat because I was like this game is worth going through again

02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:59.760
Right and it was kind of too easy on the on the lower one. So I wanted to amp it up. But humble brag

02:31:00.480 --> 02:31:05.120
It's actually like the the other people have commented as well. They're like regular difficulty is kind of too easy

02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:06.320
Got it

02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:11.040
But it's it's a fantastic game and one of the reasons why it's so good

02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:14.320
Is because they'll introduce a new fun idea

02:31:14.880 --> 02:31:19.040
And then before you're tired of it, they take it away and they give you a new one

02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:24.320
They're like, oh, you're not quite done with this. Okay. Well, it doesn't matter. This is mine now

02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:27.600
You get this other thing and it's it's fun and you get to the end of the game

02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:29.840
You're like, wow, that was cool for all its faults

02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:33.680
It takes two did a pretty good job of mixing up the gameplay

02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:39.760
Mechanics, uh, it was really simplistic because it was kind of designed for relatively casual players

02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:42.320
So I didn't really have a ton of fun with it. But

02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:47.440
I played through it and it's one of probably only

02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:52.960
Half a dozen games that I've actually played through start to finish over the last few years just because life is busy

02:31:53.840 --> 02:31:58.480
And that that really is reflective of how few of these types of experiences are out there

02:31:58.480 --> 02:32:03.520
And so I can see why people were so hungry for Overwatch 2. I mean part of it too is to Blizzard's credit

02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:08.160
They've done a pretty good job of creating characters out of these classes

02:32:08.320 --> 02:32:12.080
Um, I think it makes sense to have a single player for it. Yeah, it kind of does

02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:17.600
But I mean, I don't know should we criticize valve for never doing a campaign with the team fortress 2 universe?

02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:20.320
Like I don't know probably it would have been sick. Yeah, like I don't know

02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:24.160
I mean, what where's an rts? Yeah, where's it?

02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:28.720
Anything I I talked to people about this team fortress 2 rts

02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:36.080
That'd be awesome. If you make a game that isn't trash and it has co-op. I will buy it

02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:38.320
Like I just

02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:40.480
There's like

02:32:40.480 --> 02:32:45.600
No options. There's practically nothing that comes out and this is not just true for me

02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:49.600
I I will sometimes see when we're talking about something and we're like, ah, we're not going to do that

02:32:49.600 --> 02:32:53.440
It's not a very good idea and you'll see some people in float playing chat be like, I'll buy it and it's like, yeah

02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:57.360
Or I'll watch that thing or whatever right like I'll watch that video and it's like, yeah

02:32:57.360 --> 02:32:59.040
But we're we're competing against the algorithm

02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:03.280
We have to find something that like a huge percentage of people are going to watch not not a hardcore niche

02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:05.600
Co-op is not a hardcore niche

02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:11.120
Everyone I know that plays games literally everyone wants co-op experiences

02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:12.800
Maybe not to play with me

02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:19.120
But to play with somebody whether it's their partner or just another friend that they like playing games with or whatever and there's like

02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:22.560
So few of them

02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:28.080
Yeah, someone in float playing chat michael's like portal 2 is another good single player game. It's like, yeah, but how long ago was portal 2?

02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:33.120
Yeah, you're not wrong like we're not we're we're we're not angry

02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:39.280
With you we're angry with the situation the fact that I still recommend people go back and play portal 2

02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:44.720
As a co-op game is crazy because there aren't a ton of like better newer alternatives

02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:51.520
Like what the heck and people will look at games like you know all the sassan's creed games used to have like competitive multiplayer

02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:52.880
Yeah

02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:54.880
why

02:33:55.520 --> 02:34:00.080
And like no one ever cared because why would you far cry

02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:05.920
Had competitive multiplayer or something like that. Why and then modern far cry has co-op

02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:10.480
But just like a bunch of other co-op games the co-op implementation

02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.280
Is like so whack

02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:18.880
Why can't you just start a new game together like uh, joe and I were playing a game called Returnal

02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:27.760
But you you have to like join the other person's thing. So the person that joins in doesn't get the progress

02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:30.080
It's only the server host

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:34.160
It's like why why are you punishing people for wanting to play games together?

02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:39.760
Stop having weird limitations of when you can play or not because there's like oh you can play far cry

02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:41.360
But you can only join for one mission

02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:44.720
It's like what so my friend happens to be playing a game and I'm gonna be like

02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:48.720
Hey, you want to stop what you're doing and come play with me in far cry for one mission

02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:53.600
And then screw off because you can't keep playing. I don't think I think that was one version of far cry

02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:55.520
I think in far cry later you can keep playing the whole time

02:34:55.520 --> 02:35:00.800
But it's just like why are there these weird like just it's it's just like trendiness, right? Like uh

02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:08.640
You you brought up games that unnecessarily had multiplayer one that blew me away was first encounter assault recon

02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:14.480
Do you remember that game? No fear. Oh, yeah, okay. Okay. So it had multiplayer

02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:20.000
I had no idea that games whole shtick was the bullet time thing which

02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:26.640
Obviously isn't gonna work in multiplayer. So it was just a super generic shooter

02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:34.240
And the atmosphere like the it's got it. Okay. That's one that I would strongly recommend if you haven't played fear go play it

02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:38.080
Um, I don't know if any of the other ones were good. I think I might have played fear 2

02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:42.080
I didn't play fear 3 although I heard that one was good and I have no idea about fear 4

02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:47.200
Um, if there is a fear 4 even is there a fear 4 fear 3, you know, it doesn't matter the point is I played the first one

02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:51.040
I really enjoyed it. Um, but yeah, it didn't need multiplayer

02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:54.720
Why can't you just make the make one good thing?

02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:58.240
And then someone in the chat tagged me and said call of duty zombies

02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:01.600
I know a lot of people play zombies. I find it very repetitive and boring

02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:07.520
It's a preference thing whatever what I don't understand is why can't you play the campaign together?

02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:13.920
There's other soldiers with you pretty much the whole time

02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:16.640
Like what do you mean? There's no

02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:23.280
Ah man, and like it's so difficult to make good multiplayer games and especially when you make them competitive

02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:30.800
There's all this like uh hit registration issues and netcode problems and all this like crazy not supposed to hit each other than whatever

02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:38.080
Who cares? Yeah the the level of like what you have to get to is so much lower for a co-op experience

02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:43.920
It should be so much easier. It feels it feels like people are like no, no

02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:48.560
This is a single-player game. You don't get to have my single-player game. It's like, what do you do? Why?

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:53.840
Like come on. I don't know destiny 2 is a good co-op game destiny 2 is an mmo

02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:05.600
And on that new co-op has co-op missions, but it's not the whole game. It's not the whole game. No, no

02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:10.160
I know that's not okay. No, we can't do that. The new co-op has co-op missions

02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:16.800
Sure, but it's not the storyline game. They're canned experiences and they're like weird like speedrun things

02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:19.360
Borderlands is so boring

02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:22.720
It's just ah

02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:25.280
It's diablo

02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:31.760
It's just diablo. It's first-person diablo. I just the amount of just like looting garbage

02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:33.360
just

02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:38.560
I liked the first one and then they kept releasing it and I was like, this is the same game with a new map

02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:40.960
Which is okay sometimes

02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:45.680
But yeah, but it's people are talking deep rock galactic. We tried to play deep rock galactic

02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:52.880
I think we just weren't like into it enough. It was pretty deep. What about portal 2 then? Okay. Good counter argument

02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:54.240
except

02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:57.760
Portal 2 is a is a new whole campaign basically

02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:00.320
The co-op is a new whole campaign

02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:05.440
Which is great because if you played the single player by yourself and then wanted to play co-op with a friend

02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:12.000
Now it's new puzzles. Yeah, that's fantastic. The cod if you haven't done it the cod co-op missions

02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:14.480
is not a campaign

02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:16.480
It's just it's like playing

02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:22.320
Uh, if you are an older gamer, it's like playing red alert or starcraft on like scenario mode

02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:25.680
You just like load into a map

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.760
And you go, but it's like it's better than literally nothing

02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:32.880
But it's still bad

02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:37.680
It's still really bad and I was honestly very frustrated because I heard I heard that

02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:41.200
Uh, it it had co-op and I was really excited about it

02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:45.040
And then I was so deeply disappointed with what the co-op was

02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:47.760
because as like

02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:52.640
As like hyper generic as cod campaigns are

02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:55.120
my like

02:38:55.200 --> 02:39:00.960
Gushy goblin meat brain still enjoys them. So being able to play them in co-op would be fun, but they're just like no

02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:03.920
You can't do that

02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:10.000
Anyways, sorry, I'll stop ranting time for when show after dark. Shall we do some merch messages? Yeah, we are seriously

02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:14.000
Not going to be able to get to all in this week. I'm sorry guys

02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:20.880
Uh, there's really a lot and thank you for that. That's awesome. Um

02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:28.880
Maybe we could go a little less dark than we have been people are complaining on lmg clips. Yeah, I think that's pretty good. Yeah

02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:33.680
When show after dark

02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:37.520
When well, it's a little dark when show after

02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:40.320
twilight

02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:44.320
Still a still a better show than twilight. I gotta swap over the banner

02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:49.360
There we go when after dark nice gotta love those nice little touches

02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:52.240
Good touch. Um

02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:59.280
Another thing too is like not only are we probably not going to be able to get to all these but

02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:03.680
A huge percentage of these are just going to be questions about like the new leadership

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:11.440
Oh, yeah, which I'll do a little bit, but um, probably not everything. We don't necessarily want to grind on that the whole night. Yeah

02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:14.400
We have other things to grind on the whole night

02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:21.920
Uh

02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:24.160
Hey, let's stand

02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:27.200
Oh

02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:32.000
Sure, uh, if you're not handling, uh, sorry if you're not handing over any equity

02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:37.520
How do you get taren to leave intel who i'm guessing offered large stock options?

02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:41.440
Uh, well taren wasn't at intel. Uh, he was at del

02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:48.720
Um as for the compensation of any linus media group employee, I don't think that's something that i'm going to be

02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:51.520
Uh, discussing

02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:59.600
You know, obviously we had to come up with a total compensation package of some sort that made sense for him and um

02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:06.720
And he's happy with it and we're happy with it. And that's how that's how we're moving forward. I mean, there's there's

02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:14.320
So many different ways to skin the cat when it comes to compensation when it comes to I shouldn't say compensation when it comes to

02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:17.520
total job satisfaction, right like, um

02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:22.240
I don't know. It's really it's really funny. I saw some I saw a post

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:28.720
Just a while back somewhere or something and like the way linus talks about hiring passionate people

02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:36.720
Sounds like those toxic employers that think that offering, uh, uh, a better work environment is a good substitute for more pay

02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:39.200
and I was like

02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:41.440
Yeah, I guess I am that kind of toxic person

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:46.400
Because believe it or not offering a better work environment actually does cost money

02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:48.160
um

02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:52.160
And actually does result in better happiness

02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:57.200
Then necessarily just throwing money at the onto a paycheck

02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:03.040
Um, especially past a certain point like I would say if you're at you know, barely above poverty level

02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:07.920
Like if you're not if you're not making enough then yeah, you'd probably rather just have the money

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:13.360
But I think this is gonna get misquoted. I mean probably just just yeah

02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:17.520
But yes, I do think there is a value to having a a positive

02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:20.240
What what he's saying is there's a value to it

02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:26.720
Not that he like pays people less actively because of it. Well, yeah, he doesn't go like oh you guys have snacks

02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:31.680
Therefore i'm paying you five dollars less. Oh, no, that's not how that works. I know. Oh, okay

02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:39.600
But my point is yes, I do think there's a value in you know the like it's literally

02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:42.480
Half of your waking hours

02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:44.480
five days a week

02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:47.200
Right, like there's there's value in you know

02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:50.720
Creating a positive culture where people actually don't mind being there

02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:54.560
And if you are the type of person who looks at that and goes no

02:42:54.640 --> 02:43:00.240
I'd rather have my extra 83 cents an hour and be miserable all day than i'm so glad you're not here

02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:02.960
Thank god, you're not here

02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:05.520
Um, because you sound awful

02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:13.360
Anyway, this is so gonna be misquoted

02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:18.000
But I don't like disagree with what is the the baseline of what is being said

02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:22.160
So yeah, reddit can be mad about it. I don't care. It doesn't matter

02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:26.240
Go go go beat go there. Please

02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:32.880
There's so many things that it's gonna be so interesting to just even just mentally ask myself like what will Taren think

02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:37.600
Top view 12 24 says it's not 83 cents. It's like 10 to 12 dollars an hour

02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:42.160
That is a number you completely pulled out of your ass. Wait, what is it? What?

02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:47.440
I said the the difference it would be like however much I have pulled an arbitrary snacks

02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:53.760
No, not for snacks just the difference between working in a toxic workplace and working in one that is like good to work at

02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:55.760
Yeah

02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:57.760
You don't know that

02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:03.920
I'm going to need training from the ceo on like when to stop aligning us

02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:06.800
This is just not gonna go well

02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:08.800
Okay, cool. Uh next time

02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:16.960
Linus is there any project that you're especially excited to be able to focus on now that you will have more time loving the content

02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:21.200
Yeah, I mean, I'm really excited to focus on how we can

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:27.440
You know really find the right balance between making this a good place to work and compensating people fairly

02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:31.840
This man's an expert. I knew that would happen

02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:37.040
Now mention the nukes come on. We have a we have a

02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:43.440
Nuke the compensation package benefit of working here is if you're not a non-camera employee

02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:48.000
You get to spend a significant portion of your time working in the nuke manufacturing plant

02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:52.720
Um, that's it's under the lab. It's physically under the lab. We build another ground

02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:56.640
The lab opens like this and then it can and then yeah, it's great. Um

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.560
Yeah, now who's leaking stuff? Um

02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:06.880
Like all the nuclear waste. Oh man. Wow people like really don't understand this

02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:10.480
This is wild. Yeah, I I uh, yeah

02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:15.280
I uh, I know I'm I'm feeling the same luke

02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:20.240
Huh

02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:24.640
Okay, I knew this was gonna happen because the way the way uh, there's every once in a while

02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:27.280
You'll word something in a way that is like

02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:29.520
Not wrong

02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:34.480
But very easily misinterpreted if they don't have the context for it

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:41.360
Which is everyone's gonna do that. I'm not singling you out. I'm sure I do it too, but it's just like I just don't get it

02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:43.360
Like do they actually

02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:45.600
In their heart of hearts

02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:50.560
Believe that when we added snacks, we subtracted that from our payroll budget

02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:56.320
Do you actually think that I am certain some companies effectively do well?

02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:03.280
Yeah, sure, but like those guys. Yeah, but but but that I think that might be the component that's missing

02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:09.200
Which that's not my problem. No, I understand. I understand. I understand. I understand

02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:16.000
I'm just saying when it was happening. I was like, this is gonna be bad. I wasn't saying you were saying anything wrong

02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:18.320
I just knew it was gonna be bad

02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:21.040
Uh

02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:29.200
By the way, you have a new official nickname, uh, luke nukem luke nuke nice courtesy of float plane chat. I love it

02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:34.320
Oh, man

02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:41.200
All right, next up. Yeah, oh wait. No, no, no, it's the same one. Yeah, what do I want to uh, what do I want to focus on?

02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:43.760
um, oh boy

02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:46.480
By the way, your girlfriend sounds very savvy jacob w

02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:51.120
So

02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:54.880
What is this show?

02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:01.840
Let him wear the clothes spend as much money as you want on lttstore.com

02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:10.480
Oh, man more labs and writing team integration. That's what I want to see more of I think I kind of talked about that earlier on the show

02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:12.320
Okay, we can do another one

02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:19.440
Okay. Hey dll a few weeks ago. I lost my lanyard and ube key somewhere and was not able to find it

02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:25.120
Luckily, I have a backup. What was the most costly thing you have misplaced or lost?

02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:33.280
Oh, I lost like a $400 pocket pc back when I was running my painting company. I I went to uh, an ice rink

02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:39.680
Um to watch something. I don't know. I was with yvonne. This is like very early in our relationship

02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:41.520
and um

02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:43.520
I realized after I left

02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:46.400
That it had fallen out of my pocket in the bleachers

02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:50.480
Uh, which is one of the reasons that so many of the pants on lttstore have zipper pockets

02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:52.240
because that's

02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:58.240
personally burned me multiple times in the past. Yep, and um, did I tell you that the ice rink was in suri?

02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:02.080
I don't think so. So what are the odds I got it back? Yeah

02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:08.160
Yeah, cool. Yep. Um, so yeah, I went back very quickly afterward. No, it's gone. Yeah

02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:12.720
So yeah, that was and part of it is that I don't know. Maybe I've lost something more

02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:20.400
Since then but that was back in like 2005 impact. Uh, and I did not have money. I was a student, right? So

02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:28.720
Like if I lost $500 today a that's a lot less money than it used to be and b I could absorb that

02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:32.800
Very easily compared to when I was a student. Um

02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:35.760
Yeah, it was pretty rough. I was not happy

02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:38.000
Mine

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
You know how much money I spend on

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.080
Clothes or how often I go shopping back in my dating era

02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:50.240
Um, I purchased a jacket. It was a danier leather jacket. It's actually quite nice

02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:55.120
Um, it was my favorite model that they had and then when I went and pulled it off the rack

02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:59.600
I saw the the model name was luke, which was kind of cool

02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:03.600
Um, and it like fit perfectly. You sure it wasn't chad

02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.800
It sounds like a pretty chad moment. It had one of those, uh, the like sweater hoods

02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:14.320
Cool. Okay. And like the style just really suited me really well on stuff. And then I guess one day, uh

02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:19.760
Back when I used to live in the basin suite of the house office. I must have left my car unlocked

02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:22.320
And it got jacked

02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:26.400
And I I was like actually really sad because there's very few

02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:32.480
Clothing items that I like. Yeah, people like luke spent money. Yeah. Yeah, there's very few clothing items that I've actually like

02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:39.120
Spent money on and we're like really good. How are we this similar in like weird ways? Um

02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:42.560
The the story I didn't tell is my second year at ces

02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:48.720
Uh to look somewhat presentable. I um, I treated myself to uh,

02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:51.520
uh, it was probably about

02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:59.840
400 to $450. Have I told you this story? No, I just know the I know it. Yeah, so so uh an expensive like wool jacket

02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:08.080
Yeah, um, it was super nice. Um, and I left it in a cab with my leather gloves also in the pocket of my jacket

02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:10.640
and, uh

02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:16.960
Oh, yeah, cabbie definitely never saw that for sure. Yeah gone. Yeah, that's that's the most expensive garment

02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:19.040
I think I've ever bought for myself

02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:21.360
And I lost it like immediately

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Um, yeah, I was really

02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:26.720
Not impressed

02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:33.200
Uber's not perfect, but um shout out being able to get in touch with the person who was driving the vehicle right away

02:50:34.480 --> 02:50:38.160
Yeah, like the fact that it took so because I realized right away obviously

02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:40.880
But conveniently

02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:44.480
Well, I don't know the dispatch takes time to I'm sorry. They must have taken another fair

02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:47.920
No, he didn't find anything but no way to talk to that person. So they could just be like, yeah, no

02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:50.240
I didn't see it. Yeah a hundred percent

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:53.040
Ah

02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:58.640
Okay, let's throw another one in here. Hey DLL a few weeks ago. I am reading the same question

02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:02.640
What it will Taren Tong's role be with video roles

02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:08.160
Uh, will he be occasional host or appearance or will he be primarily behind the camera?

02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:15.280
Honed in on ceo duties with the occasional cameo if he's behind the camera, then he's definitely doing the wrong thing

02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:17.440
I'm kidding. That's just like

02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:22.560
That generally means operating it. Um, but he will be behind the scenes

02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:30.560
Yeah, I don't think he's particularly comfortable on camera. He graciously agreed to come to the roast, which I just thought was pretty cool having like

02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:37.120
uh, people who knew me both personally and professionally and as a as a

02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:41.520
A collaborator, you know, like it was nice to have that variety

02:51:41.680 --> 02:51:45.280
But it was not something that I think was like his comfort zone necessarily

02:51:45.360 --> 02:51:48.960
So super cool that he did that so I wouldn't be surprised if he shows up once in a while

02:51:49.280 --> 02:51:53.840
But for the most part his job is going to be making sure that this machine runs smoothly

02:51:56.480 --> 02:52:04.320
Been a fan since you were reviewing netbooks at NCIX. What do you think worried you the most during this transition stepping down as ceo?

02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:07.040
um

02:52:07.040 --> 02:52:09.040
Worries me most

02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:13.840
Uh, I don't know. I'm mostly worried that I'll just have a hard time actually stepping back

02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:20.640
And like actually letting go of the reins. It's it's a real challenge for me, but I'm gonna do my best with it

02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:26.720
Okay, we might have to limit the number of new ceo questions. Sorry. Yeah, I mean these are done throughout the show

02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:29.280
Uh

02:52:29.360 --> 02:52:30.640
Let's see

02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:36.640
Oh boy, what have I done to myself? Uh, I'll pick one. Uh, I just don't know do the stick locks fit on the rg ally

02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:38.800
I believe so

02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:40.640
I haven't tried

02:52:40.720 --> 02:52:46.240
Okay, but I'm like 98 percent sure. Tell you what if it doesn't fit just contact support. We'll get you sorted out

02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:55.360
Hey DLL from the future any thoughts on kyle ending bitwit. It's a big loss on the industry any, uh

02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:01.920
Plans for short colors. Uh shorts are not moving particularly well. Um, so probably

02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:05.360
Not anytime soon, but you know, we'll see

02:53:06.320 --> 02:53:11.680
Good reviews, but we're not selling a ton of them. I guess people just like buying tops online more than pants

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
I can kind of see that actually because

02:53:14.240 --> 02:53:19.600
It's easier to especially for guys like tops or just yeah, whatever. I am this size. It'll probably work

02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:23.760
Yeah, whereas shorts and pants can be very very challenging. Yeah

02:53:24.240 --> 02:53:25.520
um

02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:27.520
You got to contain all of this

02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:30.320
energy, you know power. Yeah, uh anywho

02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:34.960
Yeah, thoughts on thoughts on losing bitwits content. I mean I um

02:53:35.440 --> 02:53:41.920
Oh boy, do I talk about that? Sure. I'm just great. I'll talk about this. So back when uh, paul and kyle left, uh, new egg

02:53:42.480 --> 02:53:44.480
um

02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:49.280
Kyle was the one of them because people had suggested. Oh, we should hire them

02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:54.000
Kyle was the one of them that I had actually wanted to hire more

02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:59.040
I think both of them have done an excellent job over the years. Uh, both of them have just

02:53:59.760 --> 02:54:05.200
I mean I survived as independent content creators is all you really have to say

02:54:05.440 --> 02:54:08.320
That's very tough over an extended period of time and it

02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:14.640
Almost everyone fails. Um, but I always what I what I liked about kyle was that

02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.200
I I didn't necessarily need

02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:22.560
You know paul's deeper hardware knowledge from my outside observations

02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:27.760
Um, but what I really liked about kyle was just his raw chaotic energy

02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:30.960
Um, just his the way that he managed to

02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:37.680
Inject humor and fun into tech in a way that's pretty unique like host first tech second

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:43.920
Yeah, and whereas paul has always been tech first host second, which isn't to say he's a bad host not at all

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:45.760
And he's hilarious

02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:48.320
But it's just a really really different style

02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:54.480
Um, and so yeah, I would I would have loved to uh, you know hire kyle or whatever at that time

02:54:54.880 --> 02:54:57.360
Because I I did feel like the tech industry

02:54:58.320 --> 02:55:01.520
You know would love him and and and and needed him. Um

02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:05.360
He's got a really unique voice and and yeah, it's it saddens me

02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:09.040
But also as someone who's going through my own sort of transition right now

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:11.200
I get it

02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:16.240
Right is if it's not what your passion is then you have to do something else. I just don't think there's another way around it

02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:23.920
Yeah, it it feels like the end of an era in a weird way, but at the same time

02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:28.400
he's been through a bunch of stuff recently and

02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:34.000
I'm happy that he's taking steps in a direction that he feels good about if that makes sense

02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:37.440
Um, and it's not like kyle's gone

02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:41.440
We just have different kyle. Yeah, which is okay

02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:48.320
Did someone is someone asking did I pull sponsorship on austin evans's last video?

02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:52.320
What I actually am not sure what you're talking about

02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:54.880
Uh

02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:58.560
Oh

02:55:58.560 --> 02:56:03.920
Well, I mean he has a pink car. So maybe the assumption is that I had something to do with it

02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:07.440
But no, uh

02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:09.600
All right

02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:11.600
Hit me dan. Sure thing

02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:14.080
um, let's see

02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:16.080
Oh, yeah, I should be finding ones that uh

02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:19.440
Aren't about the ceo. How yeah, okay. This one's fine

02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:25.840
Linus hope the new job makes you happy. What do you think the most challenging part of your new role will be?

02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:30.560
Um

02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:31.920
Finding time

02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:35.040
Relinquishing the old role. Yeah. Yeah, same answer

02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:37.600
I think there will also be a

02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:40.640
In a similar way to I think I've mentioned on the show a few times

02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:45.600
But I mentioned a lot off the show how there's a lot of struggles going from small company to medium company

02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:49.920
I think the process changes of everyone working here

02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:54.480
Not dealing with you in the same way is going to be difficult

02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:57.440
Yeah, people are gonna have to break a lot of habits like I

02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:02.240
I have a pretty open door policy to the extent that I can with my limited time

02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:06.320
So people from every level of the organization will come to me and say hey, look

02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:10.000
I think this is a really really awful decision that's being made. Uh, you know

02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:12.480
Do you agree?

02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:17.600
Can you do something? Um, and we're just gonna have to break that habit. Yeah, I'm just gonna have to like no

02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:22.720
I actually will not talk to you about this. You need to take this to someone else's job to someone else

02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:24.960
And uh, we have to we have to trust

02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:28.800
those people and if we can't trust them then we have to

02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:31.920
Train them or whatever, right?

02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:40.000
And this one here is about LTX, which is exciting going to be at LTX this year flying from Alabama

02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:46.160
Heck, yeah wanted to see if cosplay is allowed during the show. I'm pretty avid comic congoer

02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:52.960
That's a good question. I think as long as it doesn't violate like our security policies

02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:59.200
Like I think we don't allow covered faces or replica weapons weapons is a is an issue

02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:03.520
But yeah, you'd have to you'd have to check

02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:08.240
Um, I the best thing to do would be to contact support on LTX expo.com

02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:12.560
I believe there's also a sub forum on the LT on the line is tech tips.com forum

02:58:12.640 --> 02:58:15.120
That's being monitored for any questions to do with LTX

02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:20.800
I'm sure if you're able to send them a picture of it or send them a picture of the concept at the very least

02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:22.080
They could give you a pretty good answer

02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:28.160
But yeah, totally people have absolutely come in in costume before and it's awesome. Yeah

02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:35.920
All right, I'm doing too many things at once and it won't leave. Um

02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:42.240
Um, you got this Dan. Hey guys, what is the number one thing float plane feature video or product?

02:58:42.320 --> 02:58:46.400
You wish Linus had not leaked and what were the repercussions?

02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:50.880
Hmm

02:58:53.360 --> 02:58:55.360
I don't usually mind it that much

02:58:55.920 --> 02:58:57.920
Like there's stuff that's kind of like annoying

02:58:58.160 --> 02:59:02.800
Like you mentioned the the subscription upgrade before we were ready and that like created more work

02:59:02.800 --> 02:59:08.320
But it wasn't like it's not like the sky was falling like it just created more work. Yeah, I didn't mean to do that

02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:10.400
I didn't know like it wasn't

02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:16.800
Okay, that's something I don't know. I can't really think of much else though

02:59:17.200 --> 02:59:19.920
I think this would be more of an ltt store thing than a float plane

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:24.720
I definitely caused some problems when I wanted to wear the color block hoodie really early

02:59:25.040 --> 02:59:27.840
That's what I was from time but because I feel like it's more creative warehouse thing

02:59:28.080 --> 02:59:30.880
Yeah, because we we had a really hard time getting the

02:59:31.520 --> 02:59:36.000
The dark dyes right up against the light dyes to not run into the light dyes

02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:40.160
And so that product took like another year or something to come out after I had leaked it

02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:44.160
So support kept getting messages from people asking like when was this hoodie coming?

02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:47.840
Um, I'd say that's probably the biggest problem though is

02:59:48.480 --> 02:59:53.040
People just wanting the product more badly and I'm kind of sitting here going that's marketing, baby

02:59:53.520 --> 02:59:55.520
Um, so I don't know

02:59:55.520 --> 03:00:01.360
But you can also exhaust people by announcing something too far ahead of time. Yes, uh, like skull and bones, uh, but like

03:00:01.920 --> 03:00:03.920
Like the coal bar

03:00:04.080 --> 03:00:10.640
Yeah, exactly. Uh, so I don't know. It's a in general the float plane stuff. It's it's been it's been fine

03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:19.120
What defunct company would you revive assuming they would stay afloat once brought back?

03:00:21.280 --> 03:00:23.280
Oh

03:00:23.600 --> 03:00:25.600
defunct

03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:28.000
I assume you mean a tech company of some sort

03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:32.960
This is kind of a weird one too because like there have been companies that I would honestly name

03:00:33.360 --> 03:00:35.840
But they have been brought back but not

03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:40.560
Really with the same commodore and stuff like that. Yeah, like rare

03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:42.320
Sure

03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:48.080
Yeah, okay. Just like everybody said it's but it's it's not the same anymore though, right? Like this one zombie rare

03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:50.800
So like, you know what? I say blizzard

03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:53.360
Oh

03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:58.000
That's a spy like that. I like that a lot. That's real good because it's not they're not the

03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:01.760
I like that because they are not blizzard. Yeah, they are

03:01:02.240 --> 03:01:08.400
Activision gross king or whatever. Yeah, whatever it is. ABK. Yeah, it sucks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:11.680
I agree

03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:13.760
to NCIX

03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:20.320
Some good suggestions there someone was mentioning you should rename the company now that terrence here you should rename the company ncx too

03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:23.760
lcix

03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:29.920
Um, yeah, there's some good suggestions. Let's go. Sierra mono micro pros. Yeah, westwood

03:01:30.720 --> 03:01:32.560
pebble

03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:34.560
I want pebble back westwood to be sick

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
Voodoo 3d blizzard north. I like that

03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:46.080
There's a lot of like yeah, but a lot of these the the problem is that they were either purchased or or they were brought back

03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:49.520
But it wasn't the original team. It wasn't the original spirit. It's just the name

03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:54.560
So it just didn't matter. It's irrelevant. Like the the company name is unimportant

03:01:55.440 --> 03:01:56.240
so

03:01:56.240 --> 03:01:59.760
Man speaking of things being brought back without the original spirit

03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:04.880
Um, I I didn't get a chance to watch the willow tv reboot

03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:09.840
Because well, I heard it was awful and so I didn't bother. I just watched the movie

03:02:10.160 --> 03:02:18.400
Yeah, but apparently it's uh, it's already being pulled off of disney plus and this is to do with apparently avoiding paying residuals

03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:20.960
and also, uh

03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:27.600
Using the fact that they are no longer making money off of it as a way to optimize their taxes

03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:31.920
Gross oh, yeah, like the

03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:38.640
The fact that you're creative work however much, you know, certain people might like it or not like it

03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:41.040
That's that's sort of a completely separate conversation

03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:44.720
How whatever your creative work is the fact that

03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:47.760
For tax optimization purposes

03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:50.800
It can just be mothballed forever

03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:52.240
is

03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:53.520
so

03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:55.520
Gross, yeah

03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:01.040
There's there's shows or movies or something. I don't know which one or maybe both

03:03:01.600 --> 03:03:07.120
That have been produced and then upon seeing the finished product. They didn't think it was

03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:12.720
Not going to make any money, but they didn't think it was going to make enough money and it was better to write it off

03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:16.160
Yeah, I think it was like Batgirl or something like that. Yeah, there were there were two

03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:20.400
Oh, no, there wasn't even worse one. So that one was finished shooting but not produced

03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:24.400
But there was an animated film that actually got

03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:27.760
completely finished

03:03:28.160 --> 03:03:30.160
like actually completely finished

03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:32.400
and then um

03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:36.720
We'll never be released. I want to say scooby-doo. It was a scooby-doo sequel

03:03:37.360 --> 03:03:39.360
That movie is

03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:40.880
done

03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:44.720
And we'll never see the light of day, which is absolutely

03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:47.520
mind-blowing to me. Yeah

03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:50.400
Yep, that's really rough

03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:56.240
Oh, did I say Batgirl? Is it Batwoman? Or Batsomething? Whatever. It's something. Yeah, that one finished. This isn't a topic we prepared

03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:01.920
That one finished shooting and then the scooby-doo one actually finished post production because the contract

03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:09.440
Had to be completed. So people knew they actually knew that they were working on a movie that would never be released

03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:12.000
Yeah, isn't that wild?

03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:16.560
Okay, hit me

03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:18.080
Can do

03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:20.960
Congratulations Linus. Now that you're stepping down from ceo

03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:26.800
Do you plan to have more time for non-lmg stuff any big personal projects in mind badminton center?

03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:33.200
Did I confirm on wancho already that it's 14 courts?

03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:37.600
That was 16 14 14 it was never going to be 16

03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:43.360
It was going to be seven or 14. Yeah 14 courts has confirmed super excited. However

03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:47.520
That did put me under a bit more financial strain

03:04:47.920 --> 03:04:52.400
And the machine vision scoring system is on pause for now

03:04:52.880 --> 03:04:55.520
We definitely still want to do some development in the long term

03:04:55.600 --> 03:05:01.200
I want to I want it to be just like the techiest wildest freaking cool like badminton gym ever

03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:04.480
Sometimes things have to but it's gonna take some time

03:05:04.720 --> 03:05:09.920
That's okay, and honestly the more time it takes theoretically the easier it'll get anyways. Yeah, which is cool

03:05:11.520 --> 03:05:14.640
Yeah, I'll just pick one at random here already did that one

03:05:15.200 --> 03:05:20.560
Are there any vision initiatives or projects that you are looking forward to getting to spend more time on when you release?

03:05:21.200 --> 03:05:23.200
your ceo duties

03:05:23.360 --> 03:05:25.360
So I guess this is more company related

03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:27.680
um

03:05:27.680 --> 03:05:32.560
Wait, isn't this basically the same question? No, this one was more work. The other one was personal

03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:35.120
You already said labs. Yes integration

03:05:35.680 --> 03:05:37.680
Um, do do do do

03:05:37.920 --> 03:05:42.080
Hey linus, are there any skill sets you are looking to learn or improve in your new position?

03:05:45.520 --> 03:05:47.520
I mean we talked about knowledge sharing

03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:56.080
Yeah, yeah, I think I could do a way way better job of just helping to make our creative processes

03:05:57.200 --> 03:05:59.040
more um

03:05:59.120 --> 03:06:08.560
A little more like dynamic. I think I think that as we've grown and as I've been lighter touched on the individuals in the creative chain

03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:12.880
Uh, I've rubbed off on them less and I think that there's sometimes

03:06:13.600 --> 03:06:15.600
an unwillingness to

03:06:16.080 --> 03:06:22.080
Just do things differently like it used to be I remember when we hired um max. She was very timid

03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:24.800
And so I I I kind of had to

03:06:25.200 --> 03:06:29.440
I kind of had to hammer into her during her early days like hey if something sucks

03:06:29.440 --> 03:06:34.960
You have to tell me and I would even do things like intentionally do a bad take and ask her if it was okay

03:06:35.920 --> 03:06:39.840
And when she'd be like, yes, I'm like, no, it wasn't and she's like I know and I'm like, okay

03:06:39.920 --> 03:06:45.680
Then why'd you tell me it was good? She's like, I'm sorry. I'm like, well look that that that look that's not the point

03:06:45.760 --> 03:06:47.280
the point is

03:06:47.280 --> 03:06:52.480
You've got to be able to tell me because if you can't tell me then how are we going to make a better product together?

03:06:52.480 --> 03:06:54.800
We've got to be able to work together. That means we need communication

03:06:54.800 --> 03:06:59.040
I just I don't do that stuff as much anymore. And so I want to spend more time on that

03:07:01.920 --> 03:07:07.840
Okay, now I can get in some of the really interesting ones. Let's see what else we've got here

03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:13.120
Come on where to go

03:07:17.840 --> 03:07:24.800
Hi, Dan. Yeah, Dan Axie has stopped working

03:07:26.240 --> 03:07:28.240
Uh, maybe it maybe it got removed

03:07:28.560 --> 03:07:34.320
Uh, can you give an example of a decision that you made in the past couple years that tt would have disagreed with?

03:07:34.560 --> 03:07:37.760
How do you resolve that conflict in future corpus structure?

03:07:38.320 --> 03:07:42.080
Oh, I think a lot of our product development direction has been kind of

03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:44.320
erotic

03:07:44.320 --> 03:07:46.320
Thank you for that

03:07:47.120 --> 03:07:49.120
Um

03:07:49.120 --> 03:07:53.200
I don't think okay. Here's an example. I don't think taren would have disagreed with the lab

03:07:53.360 --> 03:07:55.680
I think that we're very aligned on that vision

03:07:56.240 --> 03:08:00.560
But he probably would have I don't know set out a budget for it

03:08:02.720 --> 03:08:07.760
Just a thing that taren might do um not like completely changed

03:08:08.320 --> 03:08:12.720
Even the not set but kind of expected budget within like a three month period. Yeah

03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:14.480
Yeah

03:08:14.480 --> 03:08:18.480
One building some people know bigger building more people. Yeah

03:08:19.600 --> 03:08:21.600
That's how I roll, baby. Um

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:27.840
And but he also I mean he also might though. Well, that's the thing is uh, the money is still coming from

03:08:29.280 --> 03:08:31.520
The organization here. So in theory

03:08:32.160 --> 03:08:37.520
If he does a good job the organization will make even more money, which means even more irresponsible spending

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:42.320
We're just going to write down how much money we're going to irresponsibly spend before we spend it

03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:44.400
Yeah, instead of just finding out

03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:51.200
After we've spent it and that doesn't mean that it couldn't change based on learning new things or whatever else

03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:57.440
Yeah, but it will still be written down first and to be clear like yvonne always made sure I never

03:08:57.520 --> 03:09:02.960
Actually did anything that we couldn't afford to do. It's just that yvonne's a lot more malleable for me

03:09:03.760 --> 03:09:07.600
She'll be like, yeah, I really don't know if this makes sense. I'll be like, please

03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:11.920
I'll just make more money. It's okay. We'll just spend it

03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:15.360
This is a really good idea. I'm pretty sure she'll be like

03:09:16.720 --> 03:09:20.640
Okay, let me see that I can do that. That's that's pretty much the dynamic. She's great

03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:28.240
Okay, next up Linus with how much you include family on the show

03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:31.600
Hosting a podcast with your wife and building servers with your son

03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:39.120
Have you ever had to debate how much of your personal life should be on the show? Oh, absolutely. I mean

03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:41.840
I uh

03:09:42.880 --> 03:09:44.880
Oops

03:09:44.880 --> 03:09:49.040
What'd you do I meant to go new line and I sent a reply so somewhat

03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:50.640
Sorry, I'm gonna interject for a second

03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:55.840
Somebody was like what software that you use on a daily basis that you hate and what changes would you make teams?

03:09:56.240 --> 03:09:57.600
And oh well

03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:03.280
I was I was new lining to type teams. I had typed slack and I was trying to get a new line

03:10:04.320 --> 03:10:09.120
Corporate communication software in my opinion is in an absolute trash state

03:10:09.200 --> 03:10:15.600
It's ridiculous that I would honestly rather use discord if it didn't have some like weird limitations on it

03:10:16.080 --> 03:10:16.800
um

03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:19.040
If there was like discord for business

03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:25.360
It'd probably just move everybody to that because like teams and slack are both just so bad

03:10:25.920 --> 03:10:27.520
like really

03:10:27.520 --> 03:10:28.480
weird

03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:29.920
Basic things

03:10:29.920 --> 03:10:31.040
And like

03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:34.720
There's some things about teams that I like more about slack and there's some things about slack

03:10:34.720 --> 03:10:38.720
They're like more than teams. I'm not saying either of them is necessarily better than the other

03:10:38.720 --> 03:10:43.360
It kind of depends on what style of team you have yada yada yada, but they're just both like

03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:48.240
I just want to send messenger back

03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:49.760
Um

03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:53.920
Anyway in response to your question. Yeah, it's something that Yvonne and I talk about a lot

03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:56.640
It's something that I feel like I kind of intuitively

03:10:57.520 --> 03:10:58.720
try to

03:10:58.720 --> 03:11:00.720
silo

03:11:01.520 --> 03:11:04.000
I think for a long time. I was probably just

03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:09.920
posting too much on twitter because a lot of the time these aren't that's it's not even really like

03:11:11.520 --> 03:11:13.200
Oh

03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:14.880
It's not well articulated

03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:19.280
Which doesn't help and a lot of the time it's just like how I'm feeling in the moment

03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:25.440
I think that platform really is designed for people to be their their worst most impulsive selves

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:30.000
So now that I almost never post on twitter, I'm definitely doing

03:11:30.080 --> 03:11:35.840
I'm definitely doing a better job of keeping my my personal feelings and my personal life

03:11:36.480 --> 03:11:41.360
offline while still managing to be a prolific online personality

03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:44.160
Yeah

03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:50.480
For luke how much emphasis is put on tests and feature flags when rolling out features

03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:56.400
I've noticed that as companies get bigger features take longer to develop as testing becomes a requirement

03:11:58.080 --> 03:12:02.240
Yeah, we do that stuff. Um, are we the best at it? No

03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:05.840
um

03:12:05.840 --> 03:12:10.960
We've had like pushes in our history to be like, oh, we need to add tests for like all the things and then

03:12:11.920 --> 03:12:15.280
It like often doesn't really help. I don't know

03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:23.440
There's a lot of people that will fight very viciously on both sides people that say

03:12:23.920 --> 03:12:27.120
Tests are a hard requirement other people that say tests are a waste of time

03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:33.600
Um, I think if you're not doing it properly, it's just a waste of time. Um,

03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:38.800
We have often not necessarily done it properly. There is a time in our history where I think we did a really good job

03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:43.040
I don't necessarily think we're doing that now, but what we are doing now is

03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:45.520
better

03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:47.920
Like qa of the stuff that we're

03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:49.920
doing

03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:51.920
So we have an internal

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:57.440
An internal platform that uh developers can use for testing and sometimes we'll like it's been pretty cool

03:12:57.760 --> 03:13:02.960
Having other teams in our slack. So like the labs web dev team and even some of the labs local

03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:08.480
Developers are in slack with us. Uh, so the labs team or the float plane team vice versa

03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:11.840
We'll be like, hey other people that don't work on this but are also developers

03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:18.080
Try to pick this apart. See what happens and it's it's useful and then sometimes we'll scale beyond that and we'll have

03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:22.640
We'll we'll throw it at another team in the company that is not necessarily technical

03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:26.480
But it's useful to have them try to pick it apart. Uh, and then we have another layer

03:13:26.480 --> 03:13:30.640
Which is the beta site which you don't have to use anymore by the way users

03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:34.320
Because the main site has been updated with all of the beta site features

03:13:34.400 --> 03:13:37.200
So you can just use the main site now and I would actually recommend doing that

03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:39.840
But we're gonna

03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:42.640
Very likely continue to use the beta site to test stuff

03:13:43.280 --> 03:13:48.960
So we have a bunch of layers of increasing the amount of users and the type of users that that try stuff firsthand

03:13:49.360 --> 03:13:53.200
Um, and that's kind of our preferred route at this point

03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:56.400
Yeah, I think there are other honestly

03:13:56.880 --> 03:14:02.160
Significantly bigger reasons why large companies move slower with product releases than writing tests

03:14:02.720 --> 03:14:06.640
Uh, I would personally say but I could be wrong there because I don't have experience at those companies

03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:10.720
Hello guys

03:14:10.720 --> 03:14:16.640
I'm in high school and my best friend's parents have video cameras to monitor what he does on his computer

03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:19.840
Do you think that this is too far? Hope you guys have a nice show

03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:23.600
Okay, sorry. Did you say high school high school?

03:14:24.400 --> 03:14:26.400
That's getting pretty old for

03:14:26.880 --> 03:14:28.080
Net nanny

03:14:28.080 --> 03:14:30.080
um, I monitor my kids my

03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:33.280
eldest is

03:14:33.920 --> 03:14:41.200
Not in high school though. Um, I think that at a certain point kids start to need their privacy and that sort of supervision becomes oppressive

03:14:42.560 --> 03:14:48.640
However, just because you're in high school or even just because you're legally an adult doesn't necessarily mean that

03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:55.440
Your parents don't still know what's better for you sometimes and I don't know everything about their unique situation

03:14:55.520 --> 03:14:57.520
I mean, maybe this individual is

03:14:57.600 --> 03:15:02.240
You know, seriously at risk of some kind of uh, self-harm for example

03:15:02.800 --> 03:15:09.920
Um, you know without getting into too much detail. I knew someone when I was in high school who spent time on like

03:15:10.720 --> 03:15:14.000
pro anorexia forums and stuff like that and

03:15:14.560 --> 03:15:16.560
you know, I think that

03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:20.960
It would have been in their parents and this person's best interest even though they were

03:15:22.080 --> 03:15:24.080
Well advanced into their high school years

03:15:24.720 --> 03:15:29.600
To monitor that and prevent that if they in any way could do that

03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:36.240
um, that's a community that someone with body image issues doesn't need to be participating in

03:15:37.040 --> 03:15:39.040
That is objectively true and

03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:41.920
um

03:15:42.800 --> 03:15:43.920
I wasn't listening to most of this

03:15:43.920 --> 03:15:48.400
You just said it's objectively true and they're talking about body image issues. So I'm hoping this is going okay

03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:55.040
Luke I have braced for impact Luke in your experience. Has it ever gone okay?

03:15:55.760 --> 03:16:02.080
Yeah, yeah, okay. It definitely has it goes okay the vast majority of the time. Um, but yeah, I don't know there's

03:16:03.040 --> 03:16:08.960
One thing that I would consider is uh, your your kids are probably not like, you know stupid

03:16:09.920 --> 03:16:15.840
So if they really want to get around it, you're telling them that you're watching them with a camera

03:16:17.440 --> 03:16:22.720
So they'll find another way the make-out corner in the basement specifically doesn't have a camera pointed at it

03:16:23.120 --> 03:16:27.440
We just assume it's going to be a make-out corner at some point, you know that that's bought under the stairs

03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:33.520
Ah, that will almost certainly be a make-out corner because you'll be able to hear anyone coming down the stairs and quickly

03:16:33.600 --> 03:16:35.600
You know assemble yourselves. Yeah

03:16:36.560 --> 03:16:40.960
Kids will be kids. Yeah, so like you have to understand that to a certain degree

03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:50.480
It's it's tough because I've I've thought about the situation of like

03:16:51.120 --> 03:16:57.200
Growing up in my house was harder for that type of stuff than most of my friends because my dad was always been technical

03:16:57.520 --> 03:17:01.600
Yeah, and that's got to be rough for for your kids as well like good luck

03:17:02.880 --> 03:17:04.880
So like I don't know but

03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:11.520
What I really want is to not have to supervise them. So that's the foundation. We're trying to build now is like, hey

03:17:12.800 --> 03:17:16.800
If you do something you shouldn't the best course of action the the

03:17:17.840 --> 03:17:23.920
The best time to tell me about it was then the second best time is now the worst time is not yet

03:17:24.400 --> 03:17:27.200
um, you know, they all of my kids know that

03:17:28.480 --> 03:17:30.880
If you do something wrong, you're in a bit of trouble

03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:34.800
Um, but we love you and we'll figure it out

03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:38.320
If you lie about it, you're in a lot of trouble

03:17:39.040 --> 03:17:41.040
And trust is hard to rebuild

03:17:41.520 --> 03:17:46.080
Um, and so that's that's really the way that we try to message everything in the hope is that

03:17:46.560 --> 03:17:53.200
We can build a strong enough foundation where they just kind of go. Okay. Yeah, it's actually a much better path

03:17:53.760 --> 03:18:00.080
To just talk about these things rather than waiting to be found out and we've found out enough things through just

03:18:00.560 --> 03:18:02.560
being watchful

03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:04.800
That hopefully we've created

03:18:05.680 --> 03:18:08.160
enough of a pattern for them to recognize that

03:18:09.360 --> 03:18:11.360
It's not actually worth it

03:18:11.520 --> 03:18:13.520
and it's better to just

03:18:13.840 --> 03:18:15.360
Talk about it

03:18:15.360 --> 03:18:17.360
hopefully, I mean who knows right like

03:18:18.960 --> 03:18:20.960
People are people are

03:18:20.960 --> 03:18:25.920
Imperfect people are messy people life is messy, right? I don't I don't know where my kids are gonna end up

03:18:25.920 --> 03:18:30.640
I obviously hope for the best and sometimes you have to figure out things on your own

03:18:31.200 --> 03:18:35.840
So like but this comes into the like you're talking about like, okay, we monitor now

03:18:35.840 --> 03:18:39.040
But he's not in high school yet. Blah blah blah blah. Yeah, there's certain things about

03:18:39.600 --> 03:18:44.720
Yourself about how you are positioned in life about the world that you're gonna want to

03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:49.440
Dive into discover do research on whatever on your own

03:18:50.080 --> 03:18:52.880
So that it feels more organic and so you can come to answers

03:18:53.920 --> 03:18:56.480
On your own so that'll happen eventually but like

03:18:56.880 --> 03:19:04.320
There's yeah, there's also people that go down terrible paths like you were mentioning so like I don't know it's tough

03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:08.960
Yeah, and it's you can't prevent it these days. Nope. Like I mean, we've got people in the chat

03:19:09.600 --> 03:19:14.960
Talking about like like porn blocking. It's like good luck. Oh, yeah, that like doesn't matter. Yeah

03:19:15.840 --> 03:19:23.040
Utterly irrelevant. You're far better off just meeting that head on you'd have to block the internet like it's literally everywhere. Yeah, man

03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:26.400
I was uh, I thought I think I'd mentioned this on wanchill a little while ago

03:19:26.400 --> 03:19:32.560
But I was on twitter looking at just like some utterly unrelated hashtag and it's like, whoa, that was hardcore pornography. Yeah, like

03:19:33.840 --> 03:19:38.240
Just just like that and you can kind of go. Okay. Well, don't have the twitter app. Yeah, but it's like it's on the web

03:19:38.320 --> 03:19:41.120
it's you can just access it through a browser and

03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:48.160
That's just that's just like mainstream. I couldn't possibly hope to block every site that just has pornography on it

03:19:48.640 --> 03:19:50.880
Like you said, I would just have to block the internet

03:19:51.680 --> 03:19:54.320
YouTube I'll just be Iran. I'll just make my own internet

03:19:56.480 --> 03:20:02.400
You wouldn't be able to have any of the platforms that you do business on accessible from your house

03:20:03.120 --> 03:20:08.000
Yeah, there's some pretty wild literally any of the music videos on youtube and stuff. I was like

03:20:10.240 --> 03:20:12.240
Is this for real right now? Yeah

03:20:13.360 --> 03:20:16.880
They're actually licking alcohol off breasts

03:20:17.760 --> 03:20:19.760
Like

03:20:20.240 --> 03:20:24.880
I believe that's been a trope in music for a while, but I think it's getting like more uh

03:20:26.240 --> 03:20:28.800
Less covered up. Yeah, it feels yeah

03:20:31.920 --> 03:20:33.920
Oh such a parent way of saying that

03:20:35.440 --> 03:20:37.440
The girls in the music video sure

03:20:39.520 --> 03:20:43.840
Put some clothes on for god's sakes. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, sorry

03:20:44.240 --> 03:20:45.360
Uh

03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:51.760
Hi DLL hypothetically if the new ceo wants to stop the wan show for whatever reason, how would you resolve that conflict?

03:20:52.560 --> 03:20:54.560
Stop the wan show

03:20:54.560 --> 03:20:58.880
um, well, I think we would sit down and look at the numbers and um

03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:04.880
You know, here's that here's that dashboard. I'm not supposed to leak and there's a number for you

03:21:05.440 --> 03:21:09.680
I think if the new ceo wants to take down the wan show, he's got another thing coming

03:21:10.320 --> 03:21:15.040
Also, yes, I've done 630 merge messages today. Nice. He just doesn't care. He doesn't care

03:21:15.120 --> 03:21:19.200
We can set up these like certain like, uh, don't don't

03:21:19.680 --> 03:21:24.080
Reference this thing. Don't talk about this thing. Don't show this thing. It doesn't matter at a certain point

03:21:24.080 --> 03:21:29.120
I almost wonder like would we be better off just like not even telling him not to do certain things

03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:33.760
Because like I feel like it's it's almost like oh, that's a fun button to press and it's like darn it

03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:39.520
Well, no because he knows it upsets you that's what I'm saying. That's my whole point. So stop getting upset

03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:43.600
You're just giving a positive reinforcement. He's like a cat. You know, I want to be upset

03:21:44.160 --> 03:21:48.560
No, it's not time to play right now. Oh, you're gonna scratch up the curtains. Is that gonna get you to play with me?

03:21:50.560 --> 03:21:52.800
It's your fault Luke. You're the bad parent. Yep

03:21:54.080 --> 03:21:59.360
I mean, yeah, probably I don't ever get it. Come on. Leave me alone. Okay next next one next one next one

03:21:59.520 --> 03:22:01.200
All right, same sort of vein

03:22:01.200 --> 03:22:07.280
You've been doing the wan show for quite a while. Do you see that wan show out living you too as hosts?

03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:13.920
You know for a long time we tried to have other people host the wan show and it's okay

03:22:14.960 --> 03:22:16.240
but

03:22:16.240 --> 03:22:23.600
I think the wan show has changed from then and has become less of what it used to be like it used to be called

03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:28.960
Weekly analysis and news that was the joke is it was the wan show because it was

03:22:29.440 --> 03:22:33.140
Weekly analysis and news. No, it's weekly analysis and nukes on a wide

03:22:40.720 --> 03:22:43.680
It's what you get for showing the dashboard and I thought it was really funny

03:22:44.160 --> 03:22:47.440
Because the name of our show was essentially just internet show

03:22:48.320 --> 03:22:54.720
Because it's a wide area network show. Yes. Um, so it's become less of weekly analysis and news

03:22:54.720 --> 03:22:59.920
We've actually formally gotten rid of that name and it now is just internet show. Yeah

03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:04.000
It's internet show with linus and luke. I think that if we really had to

03:23:04.560 --> 03:23:07.680
Um, one of us could continue it without the other

03:23:08.240 --> 03:23:13.680
But I I honestly I feel like it'd be weird. I feel like even if

03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:18.160
I stepped back significantly like in terms of time

03:23:19.360 --> 03:23:21.760
I would probably still want to do wan show

03:23:22.720 --> 03:23:26.880
Because it's just it's basically us just like shooting the which we would do anyway

03:23:27.520 --> 03:23:29.520
and it's immensely

03:23:30.400 --> 03:23:33.600
profitable these days like wan show made no sense for a long time

03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:35.200
It was a complete waste of time

03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:39.920
But we did it because the community seemed to like it and it's always been fun for us

03:23:40.480 --> 03:23:47.920
And nowadays with merge messages, uh, wan show is like awesome. It's a it's a huge shot in the arm for

03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:50.400
For ltt store

03:23:50.400 --> 03:23:57.200
It's a great way to promote other initiatives that we have going on whether it's like whale land party or ltx expo or

03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:00.000
labs or whatever. Yeah, it's it's

03:24:01.040 --> 03:24:05.440
It's kind of awesome, right? So if someone were to come to me and say, yeah, we need to get rid of wan show

03:24:05.440 --> 03:24:12.960
I'd be like justify yourself, right? Like the burden of proof is on you now because wan show has been working pretty well for a long time

03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:14.960
I don't think taren would be stupid enough to do that

03:24:14.960 --> 03:24:22.800
Fortunately, so we'll never have to have that conversation, but it would it would it would raise serious questions for me about the

03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:29.040
The the competence of of an executive that came to me and said look, I think we need to get rid of wan show

03:24:30.560 --> 03:24:36.080
I mean, yeah, I caused some pr uproar or whatever else, but you know what they say no publicity is bad publicity, right?

03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:40.000
It feels less true these days. No wait

03:24:40.960 --> 03:24:42.960
Unless you get actually cancelled

03:24:42.960 --> 03:24:44.960
Yeah, I I don't and I think

03:24:45.760 --> 03:24:52.480
I think it would be pretty hard to actually cancel me because you'd have to find something actually cancelable that I've done and I

03:24:54.800 --> 03:25:00.640
There's there's there's not a house of cards reference by the way, though it would have been very funny

03:25:02.640 --> 03:25:07.360
Oh, okay, I guess that took me so it's been a long time since that show. Um, what was I gonna say?

03:25:08.880 --> 03:25:12.400
There are creators that have been what I would call like half cancelled

03:25:13.360 --> 03:25:17.840
Yeah, we're like they're still around, but they're like a figment of what they used to be

03:25:18.880 --> 03:25:22.720
A figment thing say come up with a break immediately afterwards. Yeah

03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:25.360
What does that mean?

03:25:25.360 --> 03:25:32.640
Figment. Yeah, I think it's just like an imagined uh like a portion or something like uh, I think you're looking for like fraction

03:25:33.120 --> 03:25:35.360
Oh, I definitely was. Yeah, I'm just now wondering

03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:39.680
A figment is something formed from imaginary elements

03:25:40.320 --> 03:25:42.320
There you go. Yeah, so that doesn't really work

03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:45.040
Yeah

03:25:45.680 --> 03:25:48.800
Hey, people talking about like how

03:25:49.600 --> 03:25:55.680
Detrimental the backpack warranty controversy was it wasn't I don't think it was it like that's that's the thing that

03:25:56.240 --> 03:25:57.760
um

03:25:57.760 --> 03:26:02.800
Like it's that the objective numbers were that there was a lot of highly visible outrage

03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:07.200
But in the grand scheme of things the impact was actually nothing

03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:09.200
um

03:26:09.200 --> 03:26:11.200
So like I just

03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:16.080
I don't know. I it's not that I'm trying to be dismissive people's feelings about it were valid

03:26:16.080 --> 03:26:18.960
And I did not do a good job of communicating it. There were definitely

03:26:19.520 --> 03:26:23.840
Errors but from like a business impact standpoint if someone were to come to me and say oh good heavens

03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:26.320
What if a trust me bro happens again? I'd be like, yeah, and

03:26:27.840 --> 03:26:29.840
Yeah, then we'll we'll address it and we'll

03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:35.600
Fix it and everything will be fine. Just like we always do. Yeah, like that's our whole that's the whole trust me bro guarantee

03:26:36.240 --> 03:26:39.760
We'll figure it out. We always do we deal with some pretty mega fires here

03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:44.720
Yeah, that was nothing unless the actual sky is falling like we'll be fine

03:26:45.040 --> 03:26:51.200
Yeah, like I'm I'm far more concerned about what has appeared to be a significant algorithmic shift at youtube in the last couple of weeks

03:26:52.320 --> 03:26:59.680
We're we're seeing less sort of benefit from top performing videos for the rest of the catalog

03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:04.320
Um compared to what I'm used to like if I look at the last 60 minutes right now

03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:07.760
Of it one

03:27:07.840 --> 03:27:09.760
Oh man. Wow

03:27:09.760 --> 03:27:11.200
This is amazing

03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:12.480
The top

03:27:12.480 --> 03:27:18.720
Four and five number four and number five most viewed in the last 60 minutes here. Oh, no, this is 48 hours

03:27:19.280 --> 03:27:25.760
Uh, okay, let's look at 60 minutes. Yeah top one and three is this wan show and last week's wan show

03:27:25.840 --> 03:27:33.680
How is it even possible that last week's wan show is in the top three most viewed in the last 60 minutes

03:27:34.320 --> 03:27:36.880
How is it even possible that in the top?

03:27:37.760 --> 03:27:45.120
15 number 14 is a previous wan show from like a month ago or something like that

03:27:47.440 --> 03:27:53.680
What is going on with vaude discoverability right now, um, so I've been I've I've raised this to youtube

03:27:54.400 --> 03:27:57.040
But basically videos are coming out

03:27:57.920 --> 03:28:03.840
Not even performing badly necessarily. We've had a couple bombs in the last little while one of which really shouldn't have been a bomb

03:28:03.840 --> 03:28:05.840
That server video

03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:12.160
Redoing the server room or whatever it was by every possible metric that I can access click through retention

03:28:12.800 --> 03:28:20.240
Like dislike ratio really strong engagement. It was all hyper strong. The video simply didn't get served and

03:28:22.640 --> 03:28:27.840
As far as I and oh, this is another really interesting one the I'm stepping down video had basically

03:28:28.640 --> 03:28:29.920
zero

03:28:29.920 --> 03:28:32.080
knock on effect for the rest of the channel

03:28:32.800 --> 03:28:36.960
Which is not usually how that works when someone watches a video

03:28:37.440 --> 03:28:41.920
It's supposed to start recommending similar content, especially from that channel

03:28:42.560 --> 03:28:47.360
That's a video that got four million views or something stupid like that in a day

03:28:48.320 --> 03:28:50.160
and it's had

03:28:50.160 --> 03:28:54.800
No impact whatsoever on back catalog viewership. That's definitely broken

03:28:55.680 --> 03:28:59.280
Is it unique to us? Is it something that's changed overall? I don't know

03:28:59.280 --> 03:29:03.440
but you know, you have to flag these things and kind of go hey, this doesn't make any sense and

03:29:04.720 --> 03:29:07.920
That's not to say that I'm just gonna, you know, whine about low viewership

03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:11.360
Obviously, we're just gonna do our best to make the best content we can every day and

03:29:12.240 --> 03:29:15.360
We're not gonna we're not gonna we're not gonna go down without a fight

03:29:16.080 --> 03:29:18.080
but when there's

03:29:18.560 --> 03:29:20.560
Anything that looks like this

03:29:20.640 --> 03:29:21.760
or

03:29:21.760 --> 03:29:24.160
Like this always makes me suspicious

03:29:24.240 --> 03:29:28.320
I also report it to youtube when I feel like something unnaturally positive happened

03:29:28.880 --> 03:29:30.880
Hey, for some reason

03:29:31.040 --> 03:29:32.080
We are

03:29:32.080 --> 03:29:36.480
Swimming hard with the current right now like this was a kind of a crap video

03:29:36.960 --> 03:29:41.440
And it had almost no impact on the overall viewership of the channel like it just

03:29:42.160 --> 03:29:43.920
is going

03:29:43.920 --> 03:29:45.920
hard right now

03:29:45.920 --> 03:29:47.120
or

03:29:47.120 --> 03:29:49.120
It just it just makes no sense

03:29:49.760 --> 03:29:54.320
And these algorithmic shifts they happen they happen all the time right like you'll go from

03:29:54.960 --> 03:30:00.080
Uploading a sponsored showcase that gets a million and a half views to uploading an absolute

03:30:00.560 --> 03:30:07.760
Banger of a unique creative video that gets 1.1 right like it's all over the place and

03:30:10.160 --> 03:30:12.000
Yeah, we'll figure it out

03:30:12.000 --> 03:30:16.160
Mr. Food drama says my recommended videos past few weeks have been of zero interest to me

03:30:16.400 --> 03:30:19.760
You know, I don't know and that's the thing is that's an individual person

03:30:19.920 --> 03:30:26.000
Even google's engineers though don't fully understand how their recommendation machine learning engines work

03:30:26.640 --> 03:30:31.360
That's kind of the nature of it. They feed it what they want the desired outcome to be and it shifts it morphs

03:30:32.240 --> 03:30:34.240
so

03:30:35.360 --> 03:30:42.000
Oh, okay nighttime astronaut says youtube is definitely moving against older videos zephrank animal facts posted about it this week too

03:30:42.720 --> 03:30:48.080
That doesn't definitely mean anything. It could be niche specific. It could be creator specific

03:30:48.480 --> 03:30:49.680
um

03:30:49.920 --> 03:30:52.480
What I do know is that live

03:30:53.200 --> 03:30:54.400
is

03:30:54.400 --> 03:31:00.160
Handled differently algorithmically and so the fact that all of a sudden live streams

03:31:00.800 --> 03:31:02.560
are just

03:31:02.560 --> 03:31:04.560
dramatically

03:31:04.720 --> 03:31:07.680
Disproportionately represented in recent

03:31:08.400 --> 03:31:15.840
In recent views like this recent the last 60 minutes should be predominantly videos. We just published because they won't have

03:31:16.960 --> 03:31:18.960
Dropped off as much yet

03:31:19.440 --> 03:31:21.760
The fact that of these 15

03:31:22.400 --> 03:31:24.400
one two

03:31:27.760 --> 03:31:30.240
Three four of them our live streams

03:31:31.200 --> 03:31:32.560
is

03:31:32.560 --> 03:31:34.560
wild. Yeah

03:31:34.560 --> 03:31:37.280
When's the last time we did a live stream other than wancho?

03:31:38.160 --> 03:31:43.840
Why is it that some stupid live stream building a computer from four weeks ago is getting more videos right now in this

03:31:43.920 --> 03:31:48.240
Or more views right now in this moment than a video we published like four days ago

03:31:49.680 --> 03:31:51.760
That should be literally impossible

03:31:52.560 --> 03:31:59.760
Especially if that video from four days ago has much better engagement much better retention much better everything you should be feeding them something good

03:32:01.440 --> 03:32:04.720
But just because they they are completely different

03:32:05.360 --> 03:32:07.360
search and discovery teams

03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:10.080
They behave really differently and I can't I can't explain it

03:32:10.560 --> 03:32:20.560
Okay, here we go another one. Hey dll. I appreciate how much work the team does to create great content all year round

03:32:20.880 --> 03:32:27.600
Has ltt labs always been one of the end goals or vision for ltt or when did that really come to be?

03:32:29.040 --> 03:32:34.960
Man the five-year plan was like me and some bros making tech videos and hopefully we can all get paid a living wage

03:32:36.000 --> 03:32:38.000
We talked about that a lot

03:32:38.400 --> 03:32:40.400
I had no idea

03:32:43.520 --> 03:32:47.200
I all I'm totally qualified to be a chief vision officer obviously

03:32:48.800 --> 03:32:51.600
Yeah, I mean it's a vision for six months out. That's good enough for us

03:32:52.400 --> 03:32:56.400
Hi all Linus. What's the best memory you've made with your tycan thus far?

03:32:57.120 --> 03:33:00.880
Uh, how about the one where I was actually able to drive it?

03:33:01.440 --> 03:33:06.960
Um, it's been in the shop for like three weeks the first two of which they couldn't even be arsed to give me a courtesy car

03:33:07.920 --> 03:33:11.840
I got into it one morning and it just said like battery error or something

03:33:11.840 --> 03:33:13.840
I don't know I took a picture of it and basically

03:33:14.240 --> 03:33:16.240
Send it to the dealership and they're like

03:33:16.480 --> 03:33:18.480
Yep needs to be towed

03:33:19.440 --> 03:33:24.960
Okay, um, and then I heard back, you know relatively quickly I guess to their credit

03:33:25.360 --> 03:33:31.760
Um, that no I would not be getting a courtesy car because they would rather give me nothing than give me something that isn't a Porsche

03:33:33.280 --> 03:33:36.000
So have them on hand. Yeah, um

03:33:36.800 --> 03:33:40.960
Okay, sure. I imagine being that far up your own butthole

03:33:41.920 --> 03:33:43.920
that you would rather say

03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:46.000
F*** you to a customer then

03:33:49.360 --> 03:33:56.320
Anyway, um, and then uh, I heard back that they apparently do not have a it's a bad cell

03:33:56.960 --> 03:34:01.440
Uh, and they do not have a single replacement cell on the entire f***ing continent

03:34:01.840 --> 03:34:09.200
So they need to bring one in from Germany and the ETA that I was given after the diagnosis was three weeks, which I think were

03:34:10.160 --> 03:34:16.880
I don't know two weeks into or something like that. I all these don't take these numbers as you know, gospel truth or anything like that

03:34:16.960 --> 03:34:18.960
But yeah, I've been driving the volt again. So

03:34:19.200 --> 03:34:21.200
Uh, cool

03:34:21.920 --> 03:34:30.080
Um, good job. Good job. Porsche great experience. Uh, you definitely shouldn't have replacement parts on hand to fix your cars

03:34:30.480 --> 03:34:32.480
That would be stupid

03:34:33.680 --> 03:34:36.240
You know, it's really crazy about like my old car

03:34:38.160 --> 03:34:39.840
It just always works

03:34:39.840 --> 03:34:44.720
Yeah, it's always fine. I mean, it's a Honda. Yeah. So like, yeah, what do you want a cookie?

03:34:44.960 --> 03:34:49.440
Yeah, I want I want my you chose a cookie. So you are a smart shopper. Yes. All right

03:34:53.920 --> 03:34:59.920
How would pass the Linus back when you all worked out of one room react to what ltt has become today?

03:35:00.400 --> 03:35:03.520
What would he think about screwdriver backpack labs and

03:35:04.400 --> 03:35:08.880
All of that. Oh, I'd be mind blown. I'd just be in like geek heaven. Yeah, I'd be like, whoa

03:35:09.680 --> 03:35:12.800
I want to work here. What I'm doing right now sucks

03:35:14.080 --> 03:35:16.080
I have to be in the same room as Luke

03:35:18.320 --> 03:35:22.080
I think I'd be really surprised and also not surprised at what I'm doing

03:35:23.440 --> 03:35:25.440
I'd be like, wait, really?

03:35:26.320 --> 03:35:28.320
How did I end up there?

03:35:28.800 --> 03:35:33.040
I stayed here for that long. Why did I take it? Uh, that's actually not too surprising to me

03:35:33.840 --> 03:35:35.760
once we like

03:35:35.760 --> 03:35:39.600
I bounced around jobs a lot when I was growing up, but I think that's pretty normal

03:35:39.680 --> 03:35:41.680
Like you do a different job basically every summer

03:35:42.160 --> 03:35:46.400
Um, I had tons of random odd jobs and stuff like that. But once we started on this road

03:35:46.480 --> 03:35:47.680
I was like, yeah

03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:51.040
That's what I want to do something in this realm is what I want to do

03:35:51.520 --> 03:35:53.520
And I've known that for like a long time

03:35:54.400 --> 03:35:56.800
I think we had conversations like a really long time ago

03:35:56.960 --> 03:36:01.360
Well, I was worried it would be a retention problem to you. Yeah, because like what were you going to do?

03:36:01.440 --> 03:36:05.680
Just be like a script assistant forever. Like that wasn't that was weird. Yeah, didn't make any sense

03:36:06.560 --> 03:36:08.560
What the hell are you thinking? I don't know

03:36:10.640 --> 03:36:14.480
I still don't have an answer for this, but like I saw something. I don't know

03:36:15.440 --> 03:36:19.600
I was pretty confident the whole time. I'm glad you didn't imagine it because it could have easily gone the other way

03:36:19.840 --> 03:36:24.080
It's like Yvonne her bet on marrying me not a good gamble

03:36:24.480 --> 03:36:26.960
I wouldn't I wouldn't tell my kids to make the same bet

03:36:27.920 --> 03:36:29.920
Like your parents were right. You were insane

03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:34.720
The fact that it worked out is not a testament to your incredible

03:36:35.360 --> 03:36:42.160
You know divination skills. Yeah, you were an idiot and got lucky. Well, see I don't 100 degree

03:36:42.880 --> 03:36:46.640
I don't know. I feel like that sometimes I feel like that's sometimes to be fair

03:36:46.800 --> 03:36:49.680
But I don't think it's that simple is what I think I'm saying

03:36:50.080 --> 03:36:55.760
Because the team that we had were all insane and when you have a group of insane people

03:36:56.400 --> 03:37:01.040
That are all at an age where they are able to put in infinite energy

03:37:01.520 --> 03:37:04.640
They sleep for like two hours and then get up and keep going and all this kind of stuff

03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:08.160
You can make some pretty crazy things happen and like that like

03:37:09.680 --> 03:37:12.480
First ces era level of effort

03:37:12.720 --> 03:37:20.880
If I look at a group of people that has that level of effort and that like it's never questioned willingness to input it

03:37:22.080 --> 03:37:28.480
And they're on a path of a new type of platform or or thing that people are using that is like

03:37:29.200 --> 03:37:34.960
Clearly trending to be the norm of how people use stuff. I bet on that again. Yeah, but clearly trending is like

03:37:35.680 --> 03:37:38.080
YouTube was going to be a thing. Oh, yeah

03:37:38.880 --> 03:37:40.880
Yes guaranteed at that point

03:37:41.520 --> 03:37:46.960
Okay, guaranteed is such a big word in tech online video was going to be a thing

03:37:49.120 --> 03:37:52.880
But we could have easily made the wrong bets. What if we had bet big on periscope?

03:37:53.920 --> 03:37:54.960
Yeah

03:37:54.960 --> 03:37:58.640
Right, we could have it could have you see you see stunted our growth at the very least

03:37:58.960 --> 03:38:03.440
Yes, but I don't think it would have killed us you see like a lot of the big vine creators

03:38:03.440 --> 03:38:07.200
Everyone just ends up on youtube a lot of a lot of the big vine creators

03:38:07.200 --> 03:38:09.680
A lot of the big periscope creators don't know how many of those there were

03:38:10.240 --> 03:38:15.760
A lot of the big whatever's were able to transition over to another now a lot of twitch creators have made it over to youtube

03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:21.120
I think youtube is still where people see the endgame the endgame. Yeah, sometimes there is a hit for sure

03:38:21.440 --> 03:38:23.440
But you see like the paul brothers

03:38:23.760 --> 03:38:28.880
Like they came over to youtube from vine. I think and then just exploded. Thanks for that vine. Yeah

03:38:29.280 --> 03:38:31.440
Like it's it's not the it's not the end of it

03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:35.760
So I don't know when I see that level of like passion level of investment

03:38:36.240 --> 03:38:41.440
Level of like complete disregard for basically everything except for like push forward as hard as you can

03:38:43.600 --> 03:38:48.080
In an industry that is like clearly growing and extremely quickly. Yeah, I'd make that bet again

03:38:48.720 --> 03:38:52.960
So like no, I don't know exactly what I saw but I saw the team and that was kind of enough

03:38:53.280 --> 03:38:55.280
How do y'all

03:38:56.720 --> 03:38:58.720
With the new move to the cvo position

03:38:58.880 --> 03:39:04.240
How have you prepared yourself to have an answer to a supervisor after being the ceo for so long?

03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:06.560
What happens when there are disagreements?

03:39:06.800 --> 03:39:12.720
That's gonna be really hard. Yeah, I haven't had a boss and like as long as my children have been alive

03:39:13.440 --> 03:39:15.440
um

03:39:15.920 --> 03:39:17.680
I mean

03:39:17.680 --> 03:39:20.640
In general, I think my management style is pretty

03:39:21.280 --> 03:39:23.280
Let's try to reach a consensus

03:39:23.920 --> 03:39:27.280
I'm probably right because I have more experience in this than you do

03:39:27.840 --> 03:39:29.760
um

03:39:29.760 --> 03:39:34.960
But it's not my job to just say I'm right and then go forward because then

03:39:35.680 --> 03:39:37.120
We've basically

03:39:37.120 --> 03:39:41.200
We've basically splintered at that point and to come back together

03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:45.200
We will have to we will have to undo this this damage that's been done

03:39:45.280 --> 03:39:47.760
And if we continue to splinter and we continue to

03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:53.360
Go further and further on our separate paths in terms of our understanding of what's best for the company

03:39:53.680 --> 03:39:56.880
Then it eventually becomes irreconcilable, right? So

03:39:57.600 --> 03:39:58.640
um

03:39:58.640 --> 03:40:05.680
What I like to believe is that I try to reach a consensus and if we can't I

03:40:06.720 --> 03:40:11.040
Try to evaluate, you know, what the risk is of doing it the other way

03:40:11.600 --> 03:40:15.440
Um, if it's not super high allow failure allow failure. Yep. Um

03:40:17.200 --> 03:40:22.080
I I try to or if not just the risk or I try to also evaluate how

03:40:23.120 --> 03:40:30.240
How staunchly each party believes in their particular path forward if if I can if I'm getting the vibe that they're kind of

03:40:30.560 --> 03:40:34.480
60% on it and I am 99% sure then I might say, okay

03:40:35.600 --> 03:40:37.600
You really don't seem to have that much conviction

03:40:38.080 --> 03:40:41.360
I think we should probably just do it this way or if they are adamant and I am

03:40:41.920 --> 03:40:48.080
Honestly, not that sure then even if it is moderate risk, maybe we do try to do it that way. It's kind of how I've always tried to do things

03:40:49.920 --> 03:40:51.920
I'm not always perfect at it

03:40:52.080 --> 03:40:55.200
But I'd like to think that I'm well prepared to continue to

03:40:55.920 --> 03:40:58.000
Manage like that and be managed like that

03:40:59.680 --> 03:41:03.360
Hey Linus, we're all putting a lot of hope and trust in the ceo

03:41:03.760 --> 03:41:07.440
Since he was your boss, can you share something that he taught young Linus?

03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:09.600
That left a lasting impact

03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:13.840
Oh man

03:41:13.840 --> 03:41:15.840
um

03:41:16.640 --> 03:41:19.200
Man he was really good at sort of um

03:41:20.240 --> 03:41:22.480
You know pushing me to get stuff done

03:41:23.280 --> 03:41:27.280
Uh, don't don't agonize over, you know every line on a p.o

03:41:27.840 --> 03:41:33.280
Um, the big picture is you know making sure that everything's everything's getting done on time. Um

03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:39.360
You know, it's it's a it's a huge part of our of our corporate philosophy these days is

03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:46.800
Ship something right like get something out there and you can always iterate. Um, but don't just stand still

03:41:52.240 --> 03:41:54.240
I wasn't always

03:41:54.480 --> 03:42:00.800
I wasn't always the best when it came to honesty and integrity. I've always been like a hustler a boundary pusher

03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:07.200
Um, and I'd say that you know one chat in particular that taren had with me early on about

03:42:07.760 --> 03:42:11.920
Um, some company gear that I requisitioned that probably shouldn't have

03:42:12.480 --> 03:42:13.680
um

03:42:13.680 --> 03:42:14.960
really

03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:19.520
Set me straight on that. Um, you know he he

03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:27.760
He found he found out I was like using something that I shouldn't have been using. Um, because there wasn't really any

03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:34.560
Financial justification for for the company. I was just I wanted to play with it. Um, and he was like

03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:38.000
Hey, no one else knows about this

03:42:38.480 --> 03:42:42.880
He didn't wrap me out. He just kind of sat me down and talked to me about it. And I really appreciated that

03:42:43.600 --> 03:42:48.640
Um, no, it wasn't a swing line stapler, but good joke. I got that reference

03:42:51.920 --> 03:42:56.640
Okay, so that's all I've got for curated so shall we start going through some of these potentials?

03:42:58.320 --> 03:42:59.760
Sure

03:42:59.760 --> 03:43:01.760
Okay, I think I'm gonna go straight from the bottom

03:43:02.480 --> 03:43:07.760
Hey all for career growth. Do you recommend linear growth or diagonal growth between areas?

03:43:07.920 --> 03:43:11.520
I am finishing university this year and work in tech stability

03:43:12.160 --> 03:43:15.600
Of income and maximizing income seem to be at odds

03:43:16.880 --> 03:43:20.960
I don't think there's any one right answer. You kind of have to do something that you want to do

03:43:21.040 --> 03:43:23.040
I mean this comes back to what I was saying earlier

03:43:23.440 --> 03:43:27.760
Maybe my philosophy is that you should make a place that's, you know, great to work

03:43:28.400 --> 03:43:30.400
Um, and that that has a value

03:43:31.040 --> 03:43:37.280
Because that has a value to me. I I would pass a certain point. Obviously you need enough money to

03:43:38.240 --> 03:43:39.360
survive

03:43:39.360 --> 03:43:45.680
But past a certain point I would rather go do something that is not soul sucking even if it means less money

03:43:46.240 --> 03:43:47.280
um

03:43:47.280 --> 03:43:48.320
and

03:43:48.320 --> 03:43:50.320
Unfortunately, I found a way to

03:43:50.960 --> 03:43:55.120
Turn my passion into something into into more money

03:43:55.600 --> 03:44:00.080
But you'll never do that if you don't pursue something you're legitimately passionate about

03:44:00.880 --> 03:44:02.880
um

03:44:03.520 --> 03:44:06.800
But anyone can end up in a dead-end job anyone can make a mistake

03:44:07.200 --> 03:44:13.360
Whether they go vertical whether they go diagonal, right? Like I had a family member who was you know

03:44:14.240 --> 03:44:16.480
It's a classic story, right middle-aged man

03:44:17.040 --> 03:44:20.240
Uh been doing the same thing forever and that industry

03:44:20.960 --> 03:44:24.320
declined and they just became utterly unemployable

03:44:25.280 --> 03:44:27.280
And whether their experience was

03:44:28.080 --> 03:44:30.080
broad or narrow, um

03:44:31.040 --> 03:44:33.040
That's a thing man. That's

03:44:34.240 --> 03:44:39.280
Yeah, there's no such there's no such thing as a stable job. I mean just look at the rise of ai, right?

03:44:40.160 --> 03:44:43.760
Jobs we thought were safe for another 50 years are all of a sudden

03:44:44.320 --> 03:44:46.320
At risk in the next five years

03:44:46.880 --> 03:44:50.400
There's a there's a fun thing going around uh where people are talking about like

03:44:51.280 --> 03:44:52.400
we

03:44:52.400 --> 03:44:55.920
We always knew ai was going to take our jobs, but we were hoping it would take the like

03:44:56.720 --> 03:45:01.040
Rough jobs that no one wants to do modern ai is sitting here

03:45:01.840 --> 03:45:03.840
making art and music

03:45:03.840 --> 03:45:08.320
And all these like creative endeavors that are more fun for people and it's like gross

03:45:09.120 --> 03:45:10.560
um

03:45:10.560 --> 03:45:16.480
Yeah, another thing I would mention about what you were just talking about is to not get complacent

03:45:17.680 --> 03:45:20.480
I think making just enough money to be fine

03:45:20.960 --> 03:45:22.160
um

03:45:22.160 --> 03:45:27.600
So deciding to not really worry about skill development or anything else because you're like okay right now or whatever

03:45:28.240 --> 03:45:31.520
Uh is potentially attractive because it takes less energy and whatnot

03:45:32.080 --> 03:45:33.360
um

03:45:33.360 --> 03:45:36.960
But is a really really bad idea if you look at

03:45:37.840 --> 03:45:39.600
the modern

03:45:39.600 --> 03:45:41.280
You know

03:45:41.280 --> 03:45:46.800
How much people make over time versus how much costs are going up over time that is not a fun

03:45:47.920 --> 03:45:51.440
Scenario to be in so you got to try to keep pushing

03:45:53.840 --> 03:46:00.800
Try to learn new skills try to diversify your your portfolio of skills so that if ai automates your job

03:46:00.800 --> 03:46:05.440
Or if if your industry becomes irrelevant for different reasons or whatever else

03:46:06.320 --> 03:46:08.640
You can kind of go with the flow a little bit easier

03:46:09.600 --> 03:46:10.800
Um

03:46:10.800 --> 03:46:12.240
and

03:46:12.240 --> 03:46:14.240
Also try to seek

03:46:15.280 --> 03:46:20.240
Excellence or specializations in some of those fields so that you can have career advancement

03:46:20.720 --> 03:46:24.480
Um to keep pushing keep pushing further because life's hard

03:46:25.440 --> 03:46:27.440
yeah

03:46:28.080 --> 03:46:30.480
Linus with you being a lifeguard in your past

03:46:30.640 --> 03:46:36.080
Did you know or how do you feel about the minimum age for lifeguarding possibly being lower?

03:46:36.720 --> 03:46:38.720
Sounds like a cost-cutting measure to me

03:46:39.040 --> 03:46:43.920
Did you know that in bc we used to have a what was called a training wage?

03:46:44.320 --> 03:46:47.680
Which was a lower minimum wage for

03:46:48.480 --> 03:46:53.680
Uh workers who were just entering the workforce. I think it was your first. I forget how many hours it was

03:46:54.320 --> 03:46:58.720
Um, but it was it was a lot. It was not a significant number of hours

03:46:59.200 --> 03:47:05.200
But um our minimum wage was eight dollars. I think at the time and the training wage was six dollars

03:47:05.360 --> 03:47:07.360
Or like six dollars and change

03:47:07.440 --> 03:47:09.440
um, and this was like

03:47:09.920 --> 03:47:16.800
Not that long ago. I'm not talking six dollars an hour in 1975. I'm talking six dollars an hour in like 2004

03:47:17.040 --> 03:47:20.160
Yeah, I had multiple of these. Yeah, so

03:47:21.440 --> 03:47:24.960
Um, what I assume is that this is just a way to bring in

03:47:25.840 --> 03:47:29.280
Younger less experienced people so they don't have to pay them as much

03:47:29.760 --> 03:47:34.960
And I will also say that I don't think that most people are physically developed enough

03:47:35.840 --> 03:47:43.120
Under at 16 is the age here. So under 16 you're you're telling me that some 15 or 14 year old is going to pulse

03:47:43.360 --> 03:47:47.520
Like somewhat some dead weight passed out person out of a pool. Are you kidding me?

03:47:48.000 --> 03:47:55.280
I mean luke and I have talked extensively off stream about things like standards for firefighters and um like because

03:47:55.920 --> 03:47:59.840
Is it is it known what cold sc is up to these days? Or is it like?

03:48:01.360 --> 03:48:05.440
I I don't think there's any issue with talking about it. Yeah, my my brother

03:48:06.240 --> 03:48:09.920
Has been trying to become a firefighter for a long time. It's a very difficult thing to get into

03:48:10.400 --> 03:48:14.640
Um some amount of that is like need to know the right people which is unfortunate

03:48:14.640 --> 03:48:16.640
But that's true for a lot of industries

03:48:16.640 --> 03:48:20.240
Um, but he he got in yeah, but some firefighter and he's killing it

03:48:20.480 --> 03:48:23.920
but some part of it is also just like, um

03:48:24.880 --> 03:48:31.840
The fact that standards have been have been adjusted to make it easier for certain people to get into firefighting

03:48:32.160 --> 03:48:36.720
Which inherently makes it more difficult for other people to get into firefighting and

03:48:37.440 --> 03:48:43.040
You know without uh without putting myself, you know at risk of being cancelled here

03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:47.840
If someone if I'm like passed out in a burning building from smoke inhalation

03:48:48.240 --> 03:48:53.760
I want the hugest most like jacked dude to be whose job it is to come in and get me

03:48:54.400 --> 03:48:55.200
um

03:48:55.200 --> 03:49:00.080
No question and if you're gonna relax these standards for carry strength and stuff like that

03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:02.560
um

03:49:02.560 --> 03:49:07.680
You better have a really good reason the yeah, I don't I don't care whatsoever about

03:49:10.400 --> 03:49:13.600
Yeah, I I don't I don't think the requirements of

03:49:14.800 --> 03:49:16.800
What you can do

03:49:17.120 --> 03:49:18.960
um

03:49:18.960 --> 03:49:23.680
Should should change, but I don't care who the heck it is. Yeah 100% don't care

03:49:24.240 --> 03:49:29.600
But you better be able to like get me out of there and not just me like that's the thing is when it comes to safety

03:49:30.160 --> 03:49:33.680
Dude as like person. Yeah, but some people are going to interpret that as

03:49:34.720 --> 03:49:42.080
Sure, so he doesn't care what gender the person. I don't care about anything other than whether it's me or like luke

03:49:42.800 --> 03:49:44.800
I'm a big I'm a big boy

03:49:44.880 --> 03:49:47.440
You got to be able to you got to be able to move the hoses

03:49:47.520 --> 03:49:52.480
Have you ever actually tried to like carry a firefighting hose? It's really hard like for for real

03:49:52.960 --> 03:49:58.880
Um, and those are but those are standard like I don't decide how much they weigh. They just weigh how much they weigh

03:49:59.440 --> 03:50:01.440
I don't decide

03:50:02.240 --> 03:50:09.120
How how how hard it is to uh, you know perform cpr on someone if you don't have the physical stamina to do it

03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:11.440
Then you ought not be a lifeguard

03:50:12.160 --> 03:50:13.280
Sorry

03:50:13.280 --> 03:50:17.040
Um, they like I don't know. I talked about this a fair bit at some point

03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:23.120
I don't know if it was on wanshow, but the moment the wake-up call for me when I realized that no not everybody

03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:27.280
Can do anything they want not everybody can do any job

03:50:27.760 --> 03:50:31.760
Uh was when I wanted to be on the rowing team and they wanted me to be a coxswain and I wanted to row

03:50:32.160 --> 03:50:36.560
And one of my friends uh bless his heart. Um, thank you for your brutal honesty was like

03:50:37.360 --> 03:50:41.680
Are you f***ing kidding me? I'm like six two and I'm barely tall enough to be a rower and I'm like, oh

03:50:42.400 --> 03:50:44.400
right

03:50:44.480 --> 03:50:52.560
No, you actually can't just do anything you want and sometimes there are actual requirements of a job or of uh of a role

03:50:53.040 --> 03:50:55.040
That are not flexible

03:50:55.280 --> 03:50:59.600
And to me no being able to carry someone out of a building is just sort of a requirement

03:50:59.600 --> 03:51:03.120
If you want to be a firefighter shout out firefighters by the way, and I'm just reiterating

03:51:03.280 --> 03:51:08.080
He was using dude in a general neutral. I call everyone dude. I literally call my wife men

03:51:08.880 --> 03:51:12.160
She denies it or she denied it until I proved it

03:51:12.640 --> 03:51:16.560
I was like, yeah, I call you men all the time because we were having an unrelated conversation

03:51:16.640 --> 03:51:19.280
And I was like, yeah, I just call everyone men now because it's just easier

03:51:19.760 --> 03:51:23.440
And she's like you do not and I'm like, yeah, I do. She's like, no, you don't I'm like, I do it to you

03:51:23.520 --> 03:51:29.920
She's like, no, you don't and then uh, she was like you totally don't I'm like, yeah, I do like security camera catchers

03:51:29.920 --> 03:51:32.480
And then and then I basically said, okay, tell you what, um

03:51:33.120 --> 03:51:35.760
I'll point it out next time I do it because I don't even think about it

03:51:35.920 --> 03:51:39.760
But I'll try to think about it. I'll point it out next time I do it. It was like two hours later or something

03:51:40.320 --> 03:51:43.520
Uh, we were on the way home. I was like, yeah, I don't know man. It's just like a weird thing

03:51:43.920 --> 03:51:49.280
And I waited two three four five steam boats. Hey there. I just did it. She's like what I was like, I called you men

03:51:49.360 --> 03:51:53.040
She's like, oh, yeah, you did didn't notice at all. I'm like, yeah, of course not who cares

03:51:55.280 --> 03:51:56.640
Yeah

03:51:56.640 --> 03:52:00.560
I just I know someone's gonna try to run with it. So I was just trying to re-clarify

03:52:01.280 --> 03:52:03.280
Okay, I got a couple more here to go

03:52:03.760 --> 03:52:11.280
Hey, DLL with every tv manufacturer or google tv putting more and more ads in their software. Are there any good self-hosted htpc

03:52:11.920 --> 03:52:13.920
Interfaces actually can I back up for a second? Uh-oh

03:52:15.280 --> 03:52:19.920
But yes, the solution is people are talking about like lifeguards and stuff still in the chat

03:52:20.000 --> 03:52:24.000
The solution if you can't find enough people to meet the standards is to pay more

03:52:24.880 --> 03:52:29.120
Yeah, that's the actual solution. Anyway, oh my god. That's a great take

03:52:29.120 --> 03:52:33.200
Or or make it a kick-ass job

03:52:35.040 --> 03:52:37.040
Lifeguard snacks. Yeah

03:52:37.360 --> 03:52:39.200
Lifeguard snacks. So terrifying

03:52:39.200 --> 03:52:46.160
Oh, I hate it. Okay. Don't talk about that anymore. Hey DLL with every tv manufacturer google tv putting more and more ads in their software

03:52:46.640 --> 03:52:51.680
The building's about to alarm itself. Uh, are there any good self-hosted? Can I do this at the same time?

03:52:52.640 --> 03:52:58.400
Htpc youtube netflix mb plex etc rip windows media center

03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:01.920
Uh

03:53:02.320 --> 03:53:07.440
Man, I don't know. I mean you you talked about plex already, but I don't think plex like integrates your

03:53:08.720 --> 03:53:12.160
Netflix account or anything. I'm not really sure quite what you're asking

03:53:12.720 --> 03:53:14.720
Did you disable it? I think so

03:53:14.800 --> 03:53:18.480
I will go and it's it's it's doing it. No, it's doing it. Mine's doing it. Okay

03:53:19.120 --> 03:53:22.000
You're in the building. It's still beeping. Yeah, I'm right building. I think

03:53:22.720 --> 03:53:23.840
I think so

03:53:23.840 --> 03:53:28.320
I mean, what do I know? I'm not even a ceo anymore. Am I supposed to know how to arm the building? There we go. It's good

03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:33.520
I don't know I use plex. It's all right

03:53:35.520 --> 03:53:37.520
Nice

03:53:37.520 --> 03:53:39.200
And last one I've got today

03:53:39.200 --> 03:53:45.520
Hi LLD over the years of wan shows. I have heard nods to many leadership models e.g. Simon Sinek

03:53:46.080 --> 03:53:52.800
Infinite game what leadership minds have inspired you what philosophies have you invented not gonna lie

03:53:52.960 --> 03:53:57.360
I have no idea what the f*** i'm talking about. I'm so happy you feel the same way

03:53:58.240 --> 03:54:00.560
I read this and I was like, oh boy

03:54:01.520 --> 03:54:08.160
Hey, I assumed that you would I've read some books that wendell recommended me and none of them have mentioned that

03:54:08.240 --> 03:54:13.280
But they've been great books. Thank you very much. Wendell. I am excited to go to computex and hang out with wendell

03:54:13.280 --> 03:54:17.680
So he can tell me more things. I read some of the innovators dilemma

03:54:18.720 --> 03:54:20.720
most of which

03:54:20.800 --> 03:54:26.320
I had pretty much kind of figured out there were some sort of oh, yeah, okay like moments in it

03:54:27.920 --> 03:54:31.760
I read good to great. I think or like some of good to great which

03:54:32.480 --> 03:54:35.600
Really only seemed applicable to public companies and like

03:54:36.320 --> 03:54:40.160
maximizing shareholder value a lot of times when I read those kind of books. They're either like

03:54:40.720 --> 03:54:42.720
yeah

03:54:43.360 --> 03:54:50.880
Obviously, yeah, or it's like like you're saying maximizing returns for shareholders are like some type of thing where it's like

03:54:50.880 --> 03:54:56.400
This isn't how we were. There's more to greatness than just selling your company maximizing your share price. So that yeah

03:54:56.640 --> 03:54:59.520
a lot of the ones in the tech space are all built around like

03:55:00.480 --> 03:55:07.360
Preparing your company to try to sell it to someone else, which is like, yeah, it's not the goal. Yeah, so for me. It's just like

03:55:08.960 --> 03:55:11.600
What gets us best to sustainability?

03:55:12.480 --> 03:55:14.480
um, yeah

03:55:14.880 --> 03:55:20.640
so if you if I have any if if anything I've talked about bears any accidental resemblance to um

03:55:21.760 --> 03:55:24.320
Simon Sinek then I guess that shout out

03:55:25.120 --> 03:55:31.760
Shout out Simon for being apparently awesome. Um, and I guess shout out me for figuring it out too. I don't know

03:55:33.040 --> 03:55:35.200
I'm not sure. Um, cool though

03:55:36.320 --> 03:55:39.440
What if the new CEO will stop you from being who you are? I was typing your response

03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:43.840
Uh, I don't know and when it comes to business. He like made me a lot of who I am

03:55:43.840 --> 03:55:46.800
So I'm not too worried about that. He still owns the company. Yeah that too

03:55:48.080 --> 03:55:49.440
and

03:55:49.440 --> 03:55:53.440
I own the end of this show. I'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel

03:55:54.400 --> 03:55:55.520
Bye

03:55:55.520 --> 03:55:57.520
The CEO will never stop me. Oh

03:55:58.320 --> 03:56:00.320
Okay

03:56:01.920 --> 03:56:03.920
Okay, we need to do something about that

03:56:04.960 --> 03:56:06.960
Uh, okay, that's a problem

03:56:07.200 --> 03:56:09.200
Oh, no

03:56:12.880 --> 03:56:15.380
You can watch it really slowly

03:56:36.960 --> 03:56:38.960
You
