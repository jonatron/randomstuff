<h1>More about Figma's "Dev Mode" trademark</h1>

<p>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer or journalist, might be wrong about things

<p>You may have seen this letter from Figma about the "Dev Mode" trademark:
    <br>
    <a href="GolPo0SXYAARBoJ.jpeg"><img src="GolPo0SXYAARBoJ.jpeg" width="300" height="310"></a>
    <br>
From this <a href="https://x.com/antonosika/status/1912147137728589915">tweet</a>.

<p>The USPTO case for "DEV MODE" is at:
<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98045640&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch">https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98045640&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch</a>

<p>Initially, my thought was:
    <br><blockquote>Figma trademarked "Dev Mode"? That's insane, it's been used by everyone for longer than my lifetime!</blockquote>

<p>However, a reddit comment mentioned it's actually on the Supplemental register. The most important thing you <b>don't</b> get with a trademark
on the supplemental register is the <i>"presumption of the exclusive right to use the mark in association with the identified goods and services throughout the United States."</i> [1]

<p>Actually, the USPTO defines [2]:
    <br><blockquote>The Supplemental Register is a listing of non-mark designations (such as descriptive words) that are “capable” of eventually becoming a “mark.”  That is, a designation on the Supplemental Register is not a “trademark” yet</blockquote>

<p>I found this interesting, because from what I thought I knew about trademarks, the whole point is that you get exclusive use. I'm from the UK, so I wasn't completely wrong, because
the UK doesn't have a supplemental trademark register. Sure enough, the "Dev Mode" trademark was refused in the UK. [3]

<p>Other important information is:
Mark Drawing Type: STANDARD CHARACTER MARK
This means it's a trademark for the words "Dev Mode", not a logo or design.

The other types are [4]:
<ol>
<li>Typed Drawing (legacy)</li>
<li>Marks Comprising Only a Design</li>
<li>Marks Comprising Words Plus a Design</li>
<li>Standard Character Mark</li>
<li>Marks Comprising Stylized Letters or Numerals with No Design Features</li>
<li>Non-Visual Marks</li>
</ol>


<p>The fact "Dev Mode" is on the Supplemental register is an admission the trademark is weak and descriptive.

<p>I think the fact that Figma know "Dev Mode" is probably the weakest "trademark" (or non-mark designation) you could have, yet still sent Lovable a formal letter, is ridiculous, and deserved the negative publicity. The only reason to try to get people using your non-mark designation from the supplemental register is to hope that it becomes a strong trademark over time [1]. This is completely unrealistic in this particular case, which isn't a good look for Figma.


<p>The USPTO trademark for "CONFIG" is at:
<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=88673913&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch">https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=88673913&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch</a>

<p>Again on first glance, this seems outrageous.

<p>However, the class under "Goods and Services" is important, as it limits the scope.

<p><blockquote>For:
Arranging, organizing and providing on-line and in-person interactive training classes, workshops, educational conferences, seminars, courses, educational meetings in the field of digital design, and collaboration and technology as it relates to digital design</blockquote>

<p>This means you're still free to use the word Config for purposes other than the above.

<p>This is also a UK registered trademark [5]</p>
